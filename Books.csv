Before they find Hermione the two find the troll They think themselves clever for trapping it in the girls bathroom until they realize thats where Hermione is Using magic and working together the three manage to get Hermione free and trap the troll But before they can get back to their rooms Professor McGonagill catches them As she is reprimanding the boys for leaving their rooms in order to catch the troll Hermione speaks up that she was the one who was going after the troll and they tried to stop her After that she officially becomes their friend

During Harrys first game of Quidditch against the Slytherin House Henry starts having trouble with his broom while trying to catch the Golden Snitch The team that catches it wins the game Hermione notices that Professor Snape is staring at Harry and muttering words she stops him by catching his robe on fire Suddenly Harry has control of his broom again and catches the Golden Snitch winning the game for Gryffindor

Later while having tea at Hagrids shack Hermione reveals that Snape was controlling Harrys broom Hagrid disagrees even when Harry tells him that he thinks Snape was wounded by the threeheaded dog who the children learn is Hagrids dog Fluffy He tells them Fluffy is guarding something only Dumbledore and a man named Nicholas Flamel to know about

During Christmas vacation Harry has to stay at the school Although Draco teases him about it Henry is secretly glad Christmas with the Dursleys was never very good The only toys were for Dudley But this year Ron is going to stay there too so Henry is quite happy Christmas morning brings the first gifts he can remember ever receiving Rons mom knit him a sweater Also from a mysterious benefactor he received an invisibility that used to belong to his father That night after a huge Christmas Dinner he dons his cloak and goes to the library to explore the restricted books that he has turned away from earlier by the librarian But when he opens one of the books it starts screaming so he dashes off Harry ends up in another room where he finds a fulllength ornate mirror When he looks in the mirror he doesnt see himself but a whole crowd of people Turning and seeing no one then when he turns back he sees his parents and upon closer inspection he sees other members of his family They dont speak to him they just wave

The next morning at breakfast he tells Ron all about the mirror That night he and Ron use the cloak for concealment and go back to the mirror But instead of his family Ron sees himself as older head boy and Quidditch champion After almost being caught they rush back to their room Although Ron warns him not to go back Harry goes the next night Dumbledore finds him there Harry expects him to be angry but Dumbledore just tells him the mirror shows you your deepest desire and is addictive

After Christmas break Hermione returns The group finally discovers who Nicholas Flamel was He was Dumbledores partner and the only wizard to have made a Sorcerers Stone They also learn the stone is supposed to turn lead into gold and make an elixir for immortality They think this is what the threeheaded dog is protecting
The next Quidditch match Harry catches the Golden Snitch within five minutes and the Gryffindor House takes the championship Then Harry follows Snape into the woods where he is meeting with Professor Quirrell and talking about the Sorcerers Stone

As the plot thickens the children are also worried about homework and exams coming up Around Easter Hagrid invites them to see a dragons egg he won in a poker game He would like to raise it but they are illegal so the children arrange for Rons older brother who is studying dragons to pick it up after it hatches Flush with victory they forget to use the invisibility cloak and are discovered going back to their rooms

For punishment Ron Hermione and Harry each lose fifty points for their house They also have to do detention with Neville and Draco who were also caught out They all arrive in the Forbidden Forest where they spend their detention helping Hagrid Something in the forest has been killing unicorns After a harrowing time Harry discovers it was Voldemort drinking unicorn blood to keep going until he can find the Sorcerers Stone

After learning from Hagrid that he had too much to drink and revealed to Voldemort that the way past Fluffy was with music the children dash off to warn Dumbledore But finding him gone they decide to take the stone and keep it safe When they get there the see someone else is there already They get past Fluffy then fall into a plant that tries to hold them Hermoine uses magic to get them loose Next is a large room full of birds that are actually keys Harrys Quidditch skills come in handy to catch the right birdkey Then Ron plays a violent game of chess with himself as a piece He must be captured and beaten by the queen in order to win

The next hurdle is a series of potions and a logic puzzle Hermoine figures out which potion to drink and then goes back for Ron Harry drinks one of the bottles and goes through the flame expecting to find Snape But it is Quirrell he finds instead Harry discovers that Quirrell has Voldemorts face on the back of his head Voldemort tells Quirrell to use Harry with the mirror that has been moved into the room When Harry looks in it he sees himself putting the stone in his pocket then it magically is in his pocket Voldemort tries to get Harry to join him and give him the stone When he refuses Voldemort orders Quirrell to capture him But he cant touch Harry without burning his hands

Harry grabs Quirrell and his scar produces excruciating pain Finally Harry passes out When he wakes Dumbledore is standing over him Harry tries to tell him that Quirrell took the stone Harry realizes he is in the medical ward at the school Dumbledore tells him that he arrived just in time to save him from Quirrell who couldnt touch him because he was protected by his mothers love The reason Harry was able to find the Sorcerers Stone is because he was the only one who wanted it for the stone itself not for what it could do He also tells him that he and Nicholas Flamel decided to destroy the stone Then he leaves him with his invisibility cloak

5,Germinal,"Etienne Lantier came from Paris to a small village named Montsou to find a job The times were rough so and old man Vincent Maheu named Bonnemort who worked the night shift in unloading the wagons did not give him much help nor hope Etienne met the old man when he stumbled upon the mine Voreux  Bonnemort was a member of a family that worked in a mine for a very long time now
It was early and all of the workcapable members of the family Maheu were getting ready for work Between the members we have the oldest son Zacharie daughter Catherine eleven years old Jeanlin and father Toussaint When they are working 6 years old Lenora 4 years old Henri 9 years old Alzira newborn Estelle and their mother are at home The whole family lives in a humble house and their life is filled with misery

Their house is so small that they are all obliged to sleep eat and bathe in that small area The life of the miners was miserable and the people were promiscuous prone to alcohol and sometimes even violent

Etienne came to the mine hoping for a job and as he moved towards he saw many people enter the small gate that reminded him of a mythical animal The father of the family Maheu was the leader of his group and he had just lost a member so Etienne filled in for him He was amazed by the Maheus and they by him

He worked with Catherine that he thought was a boy at first because she was very strong and also with Zacharie and Chaval who was well known for his roughness From the beginning Etienne and Chaval hated each other and Etienne didnt even realize that he interfered with the relationship between Chaval and Catherine who he considered being his wife while he obeyed him with no complaint
At the beginning we can see the difference between the workingmen and the rich people that are the owners of the mines Unlike the family Maheu who lives in poor conditions we meet the Gregorie family mine owners who lived wealthy and Maheus wife came to ask them for money The rich family that had only one daughter did not have any mercy upon her so they only gave her one bagel In the meantime miss Hennebeau comes with some prestige guests from Paris to visit the village and she tells them that everyone will be well settled in and that every now and then these surroundings is good because of the peaceful atmosphere and clean air

The work in the mine is getting more and more dangerous because of the fear of collapsing The workmen were paid by the quantity of the material they dig up and to make more money they had to put more time into building a safe construction They had no time to waste so they werent careful enough in their work Because of their carelessness on the workplace they would often have to pay which led them into a bigger misery

Etienne lived in a bar at Rasseneura who worked in the mine until he set up a strike Etienne met Souverin there an immigrant from Russia under whose influence he started to think about rebelling against the capitalists He got enthusiastic about that idea and even founded a miners organization in case they want to go on strike Unlike him Souverin thought that they should tear down everything and start from the bottom

As time passed by the situation in the family Maheu was getting worse and especially when Zacharie got married and received an empty house in the village from the company He left his home and one paycheck was gone with him

Etienne then accepted their offer and moved in their house He and Catherine slept in the same room and emotions started building between them but despite that she stayed submissive to Chaval who tortured her every day Soon she had to leave her family for him and move away because of his jealousy

The first hint of the strike was the news from the company that they are changing their conditions They will be paying less money for a wagon of coal because they would save more money like that but the workmens rage was getting bigger and bigger The event that triggered the strike was the accident in which Jeanlin Maheu hurt both of his legs
Etienne was the leader of the strike The workmen wanted to in a peaceful way get their right back but Souverin was more revolutionary and wanted to use violence to make their employers change their minds Despite the strike the situation was not getting better Family Mahau lost another family member and that was their daughter Alzira The miners couldnt get along anymore and many of them went and worked in other mines as well as Chaval and Catherine

The tension was getting bigger and bigger and the miners started destroying machines because of which the owner of the mines called the army There was a big confrontation and Maheu died in it After the bloodbath Chaval turned Etienne in as the leader of the strike and because of that he ran away

Etienne confronted Chaval and thanks to Catherine he managed to stay alive Chaval was angry and banished Catherine out of their house and she couldnt go back to her parents who rejected her Also she did not want to accept the help Etienne offered her because she thought she wasnt worthy of him

Several weeks passed by while Etienne was recovering from his injuries He was disappointed by what happened and decided to leave the mine Unfortunately a lot of the miners lost their lives and the ones that survived were working in other mines under the same conditions Even though we have a dark atmosphere in the novel the end is optimistic and the point is that a man must take the matter into his own hand if he wants a better tomorrow"
6,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury begins in the future The setting is a small town in the United States of America Many things are illegal Books and walking are two of them Guy Montag is a fireman and quite proud of his profession He wears a helmet and a slick uniform in black with an emblem of a salamander on his arm and a crest with a phoenix on his chest In this future firemen dont put out fires the burn books

One evening while on his way home up to his driveway he senses the presence of someone on the road walking This doesnt happen so he is interested It is the first time in his life anything has actually been different and interesting He sees a girl when he stops to speak with her his life is forever changed She is just seventeen years old and her name is Clarisse McClellan She tells him that she and her family are crazy They do odd things like walk When she sees that he is a fireman she tells him that firemen used to put out fires and he is surprised and doubtful Although she makes him nervous Guy is attracted to her maybe because she is so different Before she goes into her own house she asks him if he is happy which prompts him to become introspective for the first time in his life

As he goes into his own house Guy realizes he isnt happy He finds his wife Mildred asleep with her earphones on and after kicking over a pill bottle realizes that she has taken too many He calls the hospital They send over two cynical hospital workers who pump her stomach and replace some of her blood with fresh blood While this is all happening Guy goes outside and listens to the voices and laughter coming from the McClellan house Clarisse had told him that her odd family actually speak to each other Finally when the medical technicians leave he goes inside takes a sleeping pill and goes to sleep

The next morning Mildred has no memory of the night before When Guy tries to talk to her she only wants to talk about the shows she is watching on television Their house like most have three wall to wall televisions on the three largest walls in the living room The shows are usually interactive allowing the viewer to become part of the episode They even send out scripts so viewers can enter into the scene at the right spots As Guy is leaving for work he sees Clarisse standing on her lawn catching raindrops on her tongue She tells him it tastes like wine and if you rub a dandelion under your chin it will predict whether you are in love or not When it doesnt turn his chin yellow he is angry and tells Charisse to get to her appointment with her psychiatrist The state has ordered her to see one because they think she needs more sociability and that she has too much independent thought After she leaves Guy tilts his head back and catches a raindrop on his tongue

When Guy reaches the station the first thing he sees is a mechanical dog He reaches down to pet it and it growls and snaps at him Concerned Guy mentions it to his boss Captain Beatty He thinks the dog doesnt seem to like him and the Captain reminds him that they are machines and therefore the only thoughts they have are programmed all they know is hunting and killing Maybe since the hound has threatened him twice someone programmed it to react to Guy alone Guy and his exploits with the machinedog keep the men of the precinct entertained One of the men tells Guy about a fireman that committed suicide by programming the hound to attack his chemical complex Beatty tells Guy that no one would have programmed the hound to react to him but he will have it checked anyway

Every day when Guy comes home from work he sees Clarisse and they talk She asks questions that make him think and tells him that she doesnt go to school because it is too mindless and boring Then on the eighth day Clarisse doesnt appear in the morning He thinks to search for her but then his train arrives so he heads to work At the firehouse Guy asks the Captain about the guy whose library they burned down the week before Beatty tells him the guy is in the insane asylum Guy wonders aloud about the guy but luckily stops himself before he can say that he read the first line of a fairy tale in one of the books before setting fire to it

Guy asks if fireman ever put out fires so the men bring out a rule book that shows the first fire department was established in 1790 by Benjamin Franklin The purpose of the first fire department was to burn English propaganda Suddenly the alarm sounds They head to the house of an old woman She has books hidden in her attic When they push her aside to get to the books a book falls into Guys hand Without even thinking he stuffs it into his coat The firemen spray the books with kerosene but the woman still wont leave When Beatty starts to light the fire Guy tries to stop him and asks her to leave But she still refuses When Guy walks away she drops a match herself and starts the fire She dies in the fire On the ride back everyone is quiet

Life is becoming more surreal for Guy After he arrives back at home and hides the book he starts to notice that he has nothing to talk about with his wife He climbs into his own bed and questions her about when they met but neither of them can remember Mildred is detached from life The only people she is interested in is her TV family She takes some sleeping pills to go to sleep and Guy listens to her swallow counting the pills and wondering if she will forget and take more again later Before going to sleep he asks her if she has seen the next door neighbors since he hasnt seen Clarisse in four days She says that the moved away and she thinks Clarisse was hit by a car and killed

The next morning Guy is feeling ill The death of the old woman from the day before is tormenting him He tries to get Mildred to talk to him but she doesnt understand When he asks her when was the last time something bothered her she becomes agitated Then he asks her what she would think if he quit his job The argument doesnt end until they see the Captain coming up their walkway Captain Beatty says that he expected Guy to take a sick day after yesterday Most firemen experience this problem at least once in their careers Then he goes on to relate the history of the firemen with hopes of making Guy understand why they do their job This might have worked better had Beattys explanation not sounded so manic One explanation he gave is that television and other media made books obsolete because people wanted their stories in movie format Instant gratification
Another explanation he gave is that the widespread literacy made books repetitive and more condensed Then another explanation was because of people finding so much content in books objectionable and banning them From there the next step was book burning
While Beatty is talking Mildred wanders around tidying She comes across the book that Guy hid under a pillow and tries to draw attention to it Guy yells at her to sit down and Beatty pretends not to notice He continues with his disjointed history lesson He says that eventually people were only interested in magazines mostly porn with a few comic books here and there Since most houses were now fireproof the firemen became the burners of books especially the ones that could make a person above their neighbors Everyones intellectual level needs to be the same Books could make people feel they were superior Guy asks Beatty how a family like the McClellans had managed to become so different Beatty tells him that they had an extensive file on the family because of their works to change the school system that existed and made children all the same He also said that it was good that Clarisse was dead it was better for her Beatty tells Guy that he had read a couple of books in his time as a fireman and found them to be useless As he is leaving Beatty urges Guy to remember how important their jobs as firemen is Guy asks him what would happen if a fireman accidentally takes a book home Beatty says he would have twentyfour to fortyeight hours to look it over then he would be expected to burn it If he didnt they would burn it for him

After Beatty leaves Guy tells Mildred that he has no intention of going back to the fire department He no longer wants to be a fireman He also shows her his stash of about twenty books that he has collected She panics and tries to burn them but he calms her a says he wants to share them with her He has been discontented and feels that the answer to why may be in one of these books He also hopes to find something in them he can share with others He asks her to give him fortyeight hours to read some of them While they are talking someone or something comes to the door Later we discover it was the mechanical dog hunting Guy settles down to read Gullivers Travels

Guy and Mildred spend the afternoon reading but she doesnt like books She wants to go back to her television walls Guy is still unsatisfied and feels that he needs someone to talk with about the books and help him to understand He remembers an old professor he saw once on a park bench reading a book of poetry The old man tried to run away when Guy saw him but when Guy let him know he was safe the man tells him his name is Faber and gives Guy his address and phone number

Guy calls him now and asks him how many copies of Shakespeare Plato and the Bible are left in the world Fearing a trap the old man says none and hangs up This is when Guy realizes that the book he took from the woman may actually be the last copy of the Bible in existence He cant turn it over to Beatty but if he gives him one of the other books Beatty may remember what book he took and then realize he has more at home He makes up his mind to find someone to make a copy for him so he can turn it in He tells Mildred he is leaving and she tells him she has friends coming over to watch television later Guy makes another attempt to connect with his wife by asking her if she thinks the family on TV loves her back But she still doesnt understand his point
While Guy is on the subway headed over to Fabers he tries to memorize passages from the Bible but is distracted by a commercial playing over the speaker His anger builds until he finds himself waving the book and telling the speaker to shut up This terrifies the other passengers But before they can call for a guard he gets off the subway

When Guy reaches Faber the first thing he does is show him the book which alleviates his fears somewhat Guy asks Faber to make him understand the meaning of the book and other books he has read Guy doesnt understand why he is so unhappy but others like his wife seem to be happy Faber tells him that it isnt the books exactly that are the cause of his unhappiness Its that he knows something is missing and that is the only tangible thing he can point to Faber tells him that the meaning he could get from books can also be found in other media but long ago people stopped demanding it He compares it to flowers trying to live on flowers instead of soil sunlight and rain People wanted to skip the unpleasant parts of life and just live in the inane television shows He says that unlike TV books allow a reader to put them down and take the time to digest the information
Being a man of action Guy suggests putting books in the homes of all the firemen therefore discrediting them Faber tells him that its not the firemen that are the problem its the publics preconception that has to change They had stopped reading books long before the firemen started to burn them He goes on to tell Guy that they just have to be patient The upcoming war will end the TV families Guy thinks that means they will be able to bring books back into the light

Still yet Guy has an immediate problem Faber is too afraid to help until Guy begins to tear pages out of the Bible and Faber relents He tells him of a man he knows who has a printing press but he has to leave it with him Guy agrees but is unsure what to say to Beatty Faber suggests that he wear an earpiece he invented so he can prompt him on what to say Meanwhile Guy will try to give a substitute book to Beatty

When Guy arrives back home he finds his wife entertaining her friends Mrs Phelps and Mrs Bowles Guy turns off the TV and tries to engage them in conversation only to discover they dont know enough to carry one on They have no opinion on the war even though some of their family members are involved When he asks them about the last presidential election the women are superficial and say that they chose who to vote for by his physical attributes This enrages Guy so he pulls out a book of poetry against the warnings from his wife and Faber speaking in his ear

He begins to read them a poem Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold Mrs Phelps whose husband has just left for the war begins to weep The women are frightened and Mildred tries to comfort them by telling them that firemen are allowed to bring home one book a year so they can show their families how useless they are In his ear Faber is urging Guy to agree with Mildreds lie With Fabers encouragement he drops the book in the incinerator Then Guy yells at the women to leave while Mildred goes to bed Guy discovers his wife has been burning his books one by one and wonders if they women are right and its better to just focus on the pleasures of life leave the realities alone Faber says he would agree if it wasnt for the war looming so close Faber tells him If you hide your ignorance no one will hit you and youll never learn

Guy takes a book to the firehouse Beatty tosses it in the trash without even looking at it Then Beatty throws out a lot of literary quotations to confuse Guy and make him believe books are better burned than read Suddenly an alarm comes through and everyone grabs their gear When the reach their destination Guy is distressed to see it is his house Guy sees his wife leaving the house with a suitcase and jumping into a waiting cab That is when he realizes she is the one who called the fire department Beatty gives Guy the flame thrower and orders hi to burn his house Afterward Beatty places Guy under arrest When Beatty notices that Guy is listening to someone in the earbud he takes it and says that he will have it traced back to whoever is on the other end and is giving Guy his orders
When Beatty throws out more literary quotes Guy has had enough With Beattys last quote from Julius Caesar Guy turns the flamethrower on him and burns him to a crisp The other firemen are frozen in place and Guy knocks them all out But he is attacked by the mechanical dog who injects him with an anesthetic before Guy turns the flamethrower on it destroying it Guy is on the run which is made more difficult with a leg that is now numb But first he collects the four books Mildred left in her burning fury He hears sirens and stumbles off He puts his usual official radio in his ear and hears the police put out a warning about him Describing him and putting all the citizens on alert Soon he sees a car coming at him and thinking it is a police car he is surprised to see it is a bunch of teenagers who would have mowed him down with little regret He angrily wonders if these are the same teenagers who killed Clarisse Then he drops off the books in another firemans house and calls the police

After this Guy goes back to Fabers house He tells the professor what has happened and gives him some money to get away Faber tells him to follow the railroad tracks where he will find homeless intellectuals Guy takes a suitcase full of Fabers old clothes and tells Faber how to remove any traces of his scent so the dogs that have been sent to find him wont be alerted Guy manages to avoid the search party by looking in the houses he runs past Everyone is watching the chase over their huge TVs When he reaches the river he jumps in further confusing the search party He sees the helicopters are headed in the opposite direction so he leaves the river and begins to follow the tracks Guy comes across a group of homeless men They invite him to join them they had been tracing his escape on their portable television set The men tell him that the government will soon choose a scapegoat to avoid the embarrassment of losing him Soon a solitary man walking down the street is attacked by the dog and killed He was chosen because he was walking on the street alone Clearly an antisocial behavior The announcement comes over the TV that Guy Montag is dead

Guy learns that the Book People have all memorized different parts of classical books There are people all over the country that have done so They are all waiting for when mankind is ready for knowledge again Guy is surprised to see that the men are all so normal looking They all look like bums even They laugh and tell him not to judge a book by its cover Guy says that he has a wife in the city and is sad that he doesnt miss her and wouldnt care if she died One of the men tells him that a person needs to leave a bit of their soul in something in order to be missed Suddenly they see planes overhead they drop bombs on the city wiping it out Guy and his new friends are thrown to the ground As Guy is recovering on the ground he thinks about Mildred wondering about how she met her death Now he finally remembers meeting Mildred they were in Chicago

Afterward the men head to the city to help any survivors It is finally time for mankind to rebuild and they will need books The first building they should build is a mirror factory so they can all get a good look at themselves"
7,Don Kişot,"The plot is settled in the 16th century in a small town in Mancha Spain A 50 years old nobleman Alonso Quijano lives there He is tall skinny and a hunting enthusiast His boring life made his search for fun and excitement in old chivalry novels where the knights fought against giants dragons and other creatures to save the woman they loved

He dived too deep into that invented world that he lost his mind and decided to renew chivalry He found an old amour a rusty sword and a helmet He took his horse Rocinante and went in search of an adventure His horse didnt share his enthusiasm because he was already old

As the knights always had a lady they loved Quixote picked a woman from a nearby village and gave her many virtues in his head Don Quixote de la Mancha went unnoticed out of his home and after a day of ridding his horse he came to an inn for which he believed was a castle

Since he thought it was really a castle he asked the barmen to declare him a knight The barmen was a witty man so he went along with it declared him a knight and the adventures began on the knights was home

First he threatened a man who was harassing his servant which resulted badly for the servant because after Quixote left he beat him up even more He also confronted a group of men who didnt show respect for Dulcinea del Tobos the queen of his heart When the men saw he was crazy they beat him up and a peasant helped him get home When he got home in that state a decision was made by the people close to him to burn the books

They thought they were poisonous for Quixote and knew they had to get rid of them In the end they walled up the room with the books and lied to Quixote that an evil magician made it disappear It looked as if Quixote was getting better because he hadnt done anything out of the ordinary in the next 15 days
The truth was the opposite He was convincing his neighbor Sancho Panza to become his squire and in exchange he promised him an island where hell become the governor One day they sneaked out to search for some new adventures They came across giant windmills There were 30 of them Quixote thought the windmills were actually giants and he went to confront him on his horse but his attempts were failures Sancho had no success in convincing his that he was fighting windmills and not giants

On another occasion they encountered a flock of sheep Don Quixote thought the flock to be an army he needed to conquer and he barely made it out alive when the shepherds attacked him While Sancho and Quixote were wondering the world a priest and the villages barber went to look for them When they finally found them they placed Quixote into a cage and took him home

Don Quixote got better again but not mentally so he and Sancho went on another hilarious trip The journey got them to Toboso where Dulcinea lived and Quixote wanted to see her Sancho was supposed to arrange their meeting but he decided to trick Quixote so he told him that the first peasant woman he found was his Dulcinea He was surprised when Quixote claimed she cant be his loved one because obviously some evil magician made sure to turn a beautiful girl into such an ugly creature

In the meantime Sanson Carrasco was thinking of ways to stop Quixote from going on his adventures so he dressed up like a knight and challenged him to a battle The one who loses has to bow down to the winners will Quixote was the winner and Sanson barely remained alive After the magnificent victory Quixote and Sancho found themselves on a dukes property The duke and the duchess knew about them so they decided to have a good time by telling everyone they should act as if Quixote was an actual knight
Everyone had to respect him and the ladies had to fall madly in love with him The culmination of their visit was supposed to be the arrival of Dulcinea that will be liberated only if Sancho agrees to be whipped 3300 times on his behind The duke knew about the promise of an island Quixote made to Sancho so he decided to take advantage of that

The island turned out to be a small village Barataria The duke ordered the people of the village to accept their new governor seriously because he took his job seriously event thought he was illiterate and uneducated He had to leave his new position after ten days because he didnt know what to do and had no money

Sanson Carrasco challenged Quixote to a new dual but this time he managed to win He ordered Quixote to stop being a knight for a year While Quixote was coming back home he had a new idea He decided to live like one of the shepherds described in the pastoral literature When Quixote got home he got ill and decided to give up the adventures Sancho tried to convince him to give it one more shot but he would agree In the end he died as Alonso Quijano"
8,Cesur Yeni Dünya,"The novel begins in the fictional future year AF 632 in the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre The Director of Hatcheries is giving a group of young students a tour of the factory Through his lesson to them we learn that in this world human beings are no longer born but created from artificial fertilization of surgically removed ovaries Hatcheries not only produce one hundred percent of the worlds offspring but also raise and condition them for placement in one of five castes the World State the worldwide government of the time The five castes are named after five letters in the Greek Alphabet and run like so Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and Epsilon with Alpha embryos destined to become world leaders and so on until Epsilon embryos are put through a process that divides them into 96 cloned human beings per egg who are destined to carry out hard labor and menial work

The Director explains a process he calls Podsnaps technique which super speeds the maturation of eggs within an ovary By using this method he says hundreds of children can be created from the ova and sperm of the same man and woman within the short period of just two years The students are told by another employee of the plant man named Henry Foster that the record number of siblings created from two parents for this plant is 16000 After fertilization the embryos are placed into specially made bottles and put on a conveyor belt for 267 days the average gestation period On the last day they are decanted and considered alive While in their bottles the fetuses undergo different treatment depending on the level of caste they are to be assigned to For fetuses in the lowest three castes oxygen deprivation and alcohol treatment are employed to lower their intelligence once they are born For fetuses destined to work in hotter climates a heat treatment is provided Seventy percent of female fetuses are sterilized and known as freemartins

After showing the students the conveyor belt The Director introduces them to a woman named Lenina Crowne whose job is to provide immunizations to all of the fetuses set to work in the tropics Henry Foster chooses that moment to remind Lenina of their date that afternoon which the Director finds amusing

Next the students visit the nurseries or as their called in the Hatchery Infant Nurseries and NeoPavlovian Conditioning Rooms This is where the Hatchery trains and conditions babies in their likes and dislikes according to their castes As the students watch a group of babies in the khakicolored wardrobe of the Delta caste eagerly crawl toward nurses who are holding out books and flowers only to be rebuffed by the sound of a loud alarm and a mild electric shock The Director explains that after about 200 repetitions of this the babies will come to hate the sight of books and pretty things and as they grow they will know not to waste societies time with fanciful notions of wanting to read books and engage in anything creative

The Director tells a story of a boy named Reuben who has Polish parents As he begins the story the students blush at the mere mention of the word parents In the World State words like parents and mother and father are no longer used and have taken on a pornographic meaning Shushing them the Director continues telling his story He says that Reubens parents once left the radio on in his room while he slept and when the child woke up he was reciting a speech by George Bernard Shaw verbatim When the parents took the child to a doctor he informed the press and this incident led to the discovery of something called Hypnopaedia which is a form of teaching a child something while they are asleep The Director relates this event to the creation of the first Model T car saying it came only 23 years later As he says this he makes the sign of a T on his stomach and the students repeat the gesture reverently Keen on showing the students what Hypnopaedic learning really is the Director then takes them to an elementary level class where the students are all asleep while a recorded voice whispers to them about the disparity between the castes

After this the Director leads the students to a garden full of several hundred naked children He explains that the children are encouraged to play together in games involving complicated machines and even erotic play The Director says that the erotic games are played to lesson the stigma around sex for the children and lesson the effects of the once heavy role of sexual repression in their society

When he is busy explaining this a man interrupts him The Director is pleased to see the man and introduces him as his Fordship Mustapha Mond
Mond is said to be the Resident Controller for all of western Europe and one of ten World Controllers that govern the Word State in its entirety
Mond is very open and jovial with the students and tells them about how the controlling of emotions has helped the World State become what it is today Initially he says there was resistance to the States usage of the caste system among other things but then came the Nine Years War which involved chemical and biological attacks and subversive propaganda on part of the State that eventually weakened the resistance As a result of the war things like religion the idea of families and classic books were banned The date of the first sale of the Model T car by Henry Ford was chosen as the start of their new era which is why all dates now begin with the initial AF After Ford

The withering effects of old age were also conquered and people are now allowed to go through their whole life with a youthful body As Mond is speaking a whistle sounds in the factory to announce that it is 4 oclock and the end of the workday

Inside Lenina and Henry begin to get ready for their date As Henry leaves he snubs a man called Bernard Marx who is known to have a bad reputation Bernard overhears Henry and another factory worker talking in a vulgar way about Lenina in the changing room and is disgusted Henry decides to bait Bernard by offering him some soma a drug Bernard is angered and the other two men laugh at him
Over in the womens changing room Lenina is talking with a girl called Fanny about her date with Henry Fanny expresses surprise that Lenina is still regularly dating Henry after four months She encourages her to be more promiscuous as is considered virtuous in the World State Lenina says that Bernard Marx invited her to go with him to a Savage Reservation Fanny warns her that Bernard has a reputation for being too outspoken and also being smaller and weaker than other Alphas Nonetheless Lenina decides to accept his invitation because she finds him sweet Before leaving for her date Lenina informs Henry that she accepts his offer to go to the reservation Bernard is embarrassed by her broaching this subject in front of their coworkers After she leaves he feels odd because she behaved perfectly normally in being unconcerned with discussing her sexual life in front of others while he was the one who was ashamed

Bernard thinks about his insecurity about his size noting that most Alphas are larger and broader and that the lower castes associate bigger size with higher status He tells us that he is aware that there is a rumor in the factory that his embryo was accidentally suffused with alcohol that was meant for a lower caste child Bernard then visits his friend Helmholtz Watson a professor at the College of Emotional Engineering Helmholtz is said to be the exact opposite of Bernard being a large attractive Alpha who is also very intelligent Bernard tells Helmholtz that Lenina accepted his invitation but the latter is distracted by his own work in writing hypnopaedic phrases He tells Bernard that he no longer enjoys his work and wishes to be placed elsewhere This discussion makes Bernard nervous and jumpy

The next day Bernard and Lenina go out on a date to a wrestling match Bernard is in a bad mood for the entire date until the end when Lenina convinces him to take a dose of soma and the two have sex The next day Bernard obtains the Directors permission to visit the Savage Reservation
The Director notices the name of the reservation and notes that he himself took a trip with a woman there twenty years earlier The woman was lost during a storm and never seen again  As if coming out from under a spell the Director realizes that he has reveled too much of himself to Bernard and begins to scold him for his antisocial behavior threatening to exile him to a Hatchery in Iceland

Bernard and Lenina travel to the Reservation and are given a long story about the history of the place from the Warden Bernard gets away only to call Helmholtz who informs him that the Director is serious about exiling him to Iceland and is planning on doing it when he gets back Bernard is upset by this and Lenina convinces him to take a soma
Later the two watch a community ceremony in which a young boy is surrounded by writhing snakes and whipped until he collapses Lenina and Bernard are understandably horrified The two are approached by a young man named John who surprises them by speaking perfect English He tells them that his mother Linda came from outside the Reservation During a visit there she was injured and found by some of the Indians who brought her to the village He tells them that his fathers name was Tomakin and that he is also from outside the Reservation Bernard quickly realizes that since Linda was the name of the woman that the Director said he lost twenty years before and the Directors real name is Thomas this must be their son He is shocked by this but keeps the knowledge to himself for the moment

Meanwhile Dr Kynes has been set out in the desert without a stillsuit by the Harkonnens They have left him to die in the desert Along the way he hallucinates and is killed when a spice pocket explodes That happens sporadically because the spice underground reaches for the sunlight above ground

After Chani and Jessica arrive the emperor and his entourage do too When Paul calls Hawat forward he sees that the man is dying The baron gave him a poison to use on Paul but he refuses and dies in Pauls arms When the emperor threatens to use the Landsraad to destroy Paul he replies that unless the Spacing Guild agrees to force all the ships to leave he will destroy all the spice on Arrakis The Guild agrees He then informs the Reverend Mother Mohiam that he will not be the cause of the holy war that the Bene Gesserit want him to be even though most of the Bene Gesserit did not know that was the ultimate goal

Then FeydRautha challenges Paul to a duel which he accepts against his peoples protest Of course Feyd – Rautha cheats but he still loses and Paul kills him Then the emperor demands that Count Fenring challenge him but he refuses That is when Paul realizes that the count is almost a Kwisatz Haderach Paul then tells the emperor that he will marry his daughter the princess Irulan That will get Paul the emperors throne The emperor agrees reluctantly Chani negotiates the deal and Paul assures her that although the princess will be his royal consort she will remain his true wife"

When priests are more in word than matter
When brewers mar their malt with water
When nobles are their tailors tutors
No heretics burnd but wenches suitors
When every case in law is right
No squire in debt nor no poor knight
When slanders do not live in tongues
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs
When usurers tell their gold I the field
And bawds and whore do churches build
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion
Then comes the time who lives to seet
That going shall be used with feet

14,Dönüşüm,"The novella “The Metamorphosis” tells the story of Gregor Samsa He was a hard working travelling salesman that cared about the survival of his family The plot is settled in the home of the Samsa family that has 4 members

Gregor Samsa the main character wakes up one morning only to realize he was turned into a bug He though he was dreaming so he decided to stay in bed a little longer with the notion that it could cause him troubles at work

His family was worried about him so they started knocking at his doors Gregor was half asleep thinking about the job he felt a bit disgusted by about the exhausting travels and the impossibility to change his job because his family was in debts

He looked at his clock and realized he missed his bus and the next one came in 15 minutes Again he tried to get up but the new body and numerous legs prevented him from doing that His mother asked him to get up and he responded with painful noises that sounded like they were produced by an animal

The family got more concerned about him and soon after a colleague from his work came by to check why was he late They all went knocking on his doors hoping hell open

Gregor decided he had to get to the doors somehow but he was afraid of the reaction people will have to his new appearance He put all of his efforts into getting up and then he opened the doors with his mouth
The reactions were horrible as Gregor expected His mother fainted and his colleague ran away Gregor knew he had to catch up with him to explain that he still wants to work but his father though that he wants to attack them so he chased him back into his room with a stick He fell asleep in the room again and woke up late in the evening

When he finally opened his eyes he felt a horrible thirst His eyes would stop in the corner of the room where his family left some food so he would have something to eat when he woke up He felt repulsed by human food and didnt want to eat it

As the night came Gregor became anxious He crawled under his canapé and started to think of ways to diminish shock because of his new appearance His though it was best to take it all peacefully and calm him family that suffered because of his metamorphosis

His sister had the most understanding for him She came in often bringing him food and she cleaned the room for him While she was inside he would be hidden under the canapé Even though Gregor didnt look like a human anymore his mind and soul were human and he understood and heard everything
Time passes by and Gregor observes the events in his house He found out that his family made it out after his metamorphosis with the help of his fathers savings and his decision to find a job

His sister though it would be best to empty his room so he could walk freely Gregor was shocked with her idea because he couldnt believe theyd take away his private stuff which were his only link to his human past Nobody asked for his opinion because he was unable to speak

Gregor decided to express his disapproval by running across the room while they were taking away his belongings

While he was running around his mother was walking by and she fainted again Gregors father thought that he did something wrong so he threw an apple at him that got stuck and opened up a wound

The family decided to give Gregor one last shot to feel as a part of the family by leaving the doors open in the evening so he could see what was happening in the living room when the family gathered As time passed the family feared him less but also noticed him less

His father started working again so they hired some help around the house The newcomer accepted Gregors condition but acted harsh towards him by insulting him while she was cleaning his room
His sister still took care of him brought him food but she didnt feel like cleaning up the remains that were piling up because Gregor couldnt eat anymore and became weaker Gregors room became a storage for unnecessary and old thing and the doors were mostly shut sometimes even during the evening The reason for that was the arrival of tenants who were there because the family was going through a rough financial situation and had to rent out a room They had to hide Gregor away so his appearance wouldnt scare anyone

One night the tenants and the family gathered to listen to his sister play the violin The doors to Gregors room were left open and he felt like no one from the family cared much for his sisters talent so he decided to support her He crawled out to show his admiration for his sister

The tenants were repulsed by his appearance and threatened to sue the family because the house was obviously filthy

That event was crucial for his family Even his sister who loved him deeply thought that they should get rid of him When Gregor heard about his familys plans he was crushed He crawled back into his room with the notion that his family rejected him When he went in someone locked the door Gregor was exhausted and he died

The next morning the cleaning lady threw him into the trash When the family heard he was dead they felt relieved and decided to take a road trip and enjoy the sunny spring day"
15,1984,"Winston Smith skipped lunch in the cafeteria of the Ministry in which he worked and decided to spend his free hour at home He lived in a complex of grey buildings that looked the same and most of the members of the Outer Party lived there They were ordinary lower positioned workers that barely made enough to survive Winston worked in the Ministry of Truth which was dedicated to writing news history and the present of the Party They were involved in education entertainment and programmed art Winstons job was to correct historical facts news paper articles or any kind of documents that opposed to the opinion of the Party There was also the Ministry of Love whose duty was to enforce the law and find and kill all of the bad members of the Party From all of the ministries this one was the cruelest The other two were the Ministry of Peace which was involved in warfare and the Ministry of Plenty that dealt with the economy
Winston had a special reason to go home and to skip lunch which will cause his hunger until breakfast Recently he bought a notebook formed as a diary and it was an antique that he found in the suburbs while he was buying razors The suburbs were the home to the proles  the lowest layer of society that lived estranged from the Partys society They lived in poverty and lawlessness Despite that Winston and others Outer Partys members went there to buy what they needed and couldnt find in the Partys stores Mostlythey would buy razors soap socks…

Winston bought the notebook even though it was forbidden The members of the Party werent allowed to have any personal possessions and definitely not those that served to write down their thoughts because the right to think was unknown in the Partys regime Winston came to his small apartment and sat in the corner of the room from which he could see the Telescreen Winston only had basic furniture in his apartment but he had to have a Telescreen in every room Nobody knew when they were being watched so they had to be careful always because one wrong move could get them deleted  taken away and killed

Winston in spite of fear bought the notebook sat behind the table and decided to write At first he didnt know what to write so he wrote all sorts of thing which later became thought of hate towards the Big Brother

Door knocking stopped his writing He was scared that it was the police but luckily it was only his neighbor that asked him to unplug her sink She was a tired old lady whose a bit stupid husband worked in the Ministry and her biggest fear were her kids As all of the other kids her kids were also in the Spies They were created by the Party and often they would turn on their own parents because they were encouraged to do so by the Party
When hes back at work Winston went through the preparation for the Two Minutes Hate In those two minutes people would look videos that show their enemies and all the wars theyre going through and all of the members of the Party would sear spit yell and hate as loud as they could During that ceremony Winston saw a young and beautiful female member of the Party but Winston felt repulsed by her just because she represented everything he started to hate and it was the Party and all of its principles including Big Brother

He saw OBrien a man he thought could have the same thoughts as him Winston couldnt know it for sure but judging by his look he even concluded that OBrien could be a member of the Brotherhood a movement established by the hated Goldstein  the biggest states enemy

Tomorrow Winston was awaken by a female voice calling him to do his daily exercise Winston was 39 years old but he already felt like an old man so that morning stretch was hard for him He went to work which he neither liked nor disliked but sometimes he did it with love because he would get creative He had his tasteless lunch in the cafeteria while his colleague told him all about the new way of speech that will eliminate all unnecessary words and limit the Party members opinion even more

Almost every night Winston would have to attend some kind of organized activity that is supposed to be fun but Winston found it rather boring The activities were called free and they werent obligatory but the ones that would attend them would be seen in a different light If Winston missed any activity in his daily routine he would be considered suspicious The less freedom he had the more he thought about it In the regime only animals and proles were free As he thought about freedom he started thinking about history and its instability so he tried to remember his life as the only remaining unchanged facts

Once as he was walking down the suburbs he entered a bar He met an old man bought him a beer and started questioning him about the past He wanted to know everything  any little detail that the old man could remember about the past but unfortunately the old mans recollections were corrupted by the Partys constant history modifications His memory was full of holes that he couldnt fill The disappointed Winston kept walking down the street and then he found himself in front of the antique shop where he had bought his notebook When he walked in the salesman recognized him They started talking about old times and that conversation spurred all memories of his childhood He bought another forbidden thing  a small red coral and he placed it in his pocket The store owner showed him a small room above the store It was small and cozy but the most shocking thing about it was that it had no Telescreen Winston was determined to come back here

While he was leaving the shop he noticed a black haired girl following him It was the same girl he saw at the Two Minutes Hate She was physically attractive but Winston knew that she as all of the other loyal Party members found sex repulsive because the Party promoted asexuality Winston managed to run away from her and as soon as he got home he had the sudden urge to write
For days after he saw the girl walking towards him in the hallway He started sweating and he thought he would be exposed but while walking by him the girl tripped and fell down Winston helped her but she just got up saying that shes fine When Winston was helping her she put a piece of paper into his hand When he was sure nobody was watching Winston read the note It said I love you

It was hard to approach a girl without looking suspicious but in spite of the fear Winston dared to sit next to her in the cafeteria They arranged a meeting in the crowded square They will have a chance to talk without anyone noticing that theyre a couple

On the square they agreed to meet in the woods outside town  far away from the police where the chances to be eavesdropped where the smallest The girl and Winston finally had a chance to meet She was Julia and she also hated the Party and its rules because she discovered that the most loyal members of the Party belonged to the Inner Party During their time together they indulge in physical pleasures which was a sign of revolt against the body purity ideology that the Party imposed on people

Julia and Winston meet up on different locations and then Winston called her to meet him in the room in the antique shop He knew it was mad to meet more than once in the same location and he knew they would eventually get caught but he couldnt resist her When Julia came to their meeting she would bring food stolen from the Inner Partys member She would bring the unobtainable real sugar white bread jam tea and the rarest of all real coffee

The adventure with Julia changed Winstons life He didnt feel like an old man anymore he felt no physical or psychic pain It seemed like he had a hope for a better future He worked more and regularly attended the activities so nobody would find him suspicious He felt less fear and desperation Love towards Julia made him better and happier and gave his life more meaning

One day he had another important encounter OBrien approached him  the man he hoped was a part of the Brotherhood OBrien mentioned him that he had done a few mistakes while modifying the latest article because he didnt use the new dictionary He told Winston to come to his place and pick up a copy of the new dictionary that is about to be published so he wouldnt do any further mistakes Winston consider his invitation an excuse that OBrien used to get Winston alone and convince him to join the fraternity

Julia and Winston went to OBriens knowing it was insane to show themselves as a couple anywhere OBrien was strict at first but then he got up and turned off the Telescreen Winston and Julia couldnt believe it They never saw anybody turn it off but OBrien said it was one of the privileges of the Inner Party members He sat them down and gave them some wine that they never had a chance to drink before OBrien told him about the existence of a Brotherhood that worked against the Party He asked them if they wanted to be a part of it and Julia and Winston agreed to everything except for breaking up their relationship OBrien even promised Winston to get him the book of the biggest public enemy Goldstein

Winston enjoyed his time spent in the room above the antique shop He would lie down and read with a sense of security because the Telescreen wasnt watching He read the forbidden books about the real world history He learned about the event that preceded the current world situation He would read and Julia would sleep next to him

Once during reading and sleeping they discussed music when they heard a steel voice behind them telling them theyre dead They were petrified and realized a camera hidden behind a painting was staring at them The Party was onto them They ordered them to kneel down and put their hand behind their back so that they could be arrested

Winston found himself in the cruel Ministry of Love He had to sit motionless in one of the isolated rooms and wait He could even move without a voice from the speaker yelling at him He thought about OBrien and whether he knew that he was arrested Winston hoped he would somehow save him
After a long wait a man walks into the room Winston was astonished when he saw it was OBrien At first he thought that he was captured too but then OBrien hit him Before he passed out Winston realized that OBrien worked for the Big Brother

Winston woke up in a bed and different machines and injections were plugged into him He was kicked and tortured in various ways but so cruel that in some brief moments he became immune to the pain After many tortures OBrien approached him He told him about the Party the way it rules the world history and present because she writes it The one that has power over the past and the present can control the truth no matter what it was He negated the reality that individuals remembered because the only reality was the one that the Party approved It was the law for all and it included Winston so for example if the Party told Winston that he sees 4 fingers and OBrien showed him five he had to tell he saw four

OBrien said that Winston wasnt brought here to be killed but to be improved and turned into a new and accurate Party member He told him that the Partys enemies werent even real and that the Party invented them so that the people could have someone to hate He also told him that Big Brother also didnt exist and that he was only a system that reflects himself in the elimination of those who endanger him They even created a Brotherhood that served them to discover the bad Party members because those interested in the Brotherhood are dangerous to the system

After an undetermined time span of torture they finally stopped They took him to recover and it seemed Winston accepted all of the Partys rules Before they let him go they had to break him completely They took him to the notorious room 101 He was faced with his biggest fear  a rat They threatened to let the rat out if he didnt betray Julia Winston fought with himself as much as he could but in the rush of fear he yelled that they should do this to Julia and not him That was the way they knew he was broken

The book begins with the iconic words It was the best of times it was the worst of times As with all times good things and bad things are happening depending on where the person is in social ratings Dickens wants his readers to see the correlations of the worlds of France and England during the time of the French revolution and the world they were in when he wrote his stories He is also setting up the juxtaposition of alternating themes of good and evil

One cold dark night in late November of 1775 passengers depart from a coach forced to walk a ways on their journey to Dover from London on foot beside the coach because the hill is too steep for the horses While they are walking a rider approaches At first they all think they are going to be robbed but a passenger Jarvis Lorry of Tellsons Bank recognizes the rider as Jerry Cruncher a messenger from his bank The message tells Lorry to wait for the mademoiselle in Dover Lorrys return message is simply Recalled to Life

After arriving in Dover Lorry meets with a young woman Lucie Manette She is told that her father long presumed dead has been found alive He has been taken to the home of an old servant in Paris to recuperate Lorry asks her to accompany him to Paris to see the man He must go to confirm identity and she to nurse her father and return him to health She faints in shock and Miss Pross her servant who is fiercely loyal and protective of Lucie rushes to help her Lorry takes Lucie and Miss Pross to a small poor suburb of Paris Saint Antoine There Lorry and Lucie go to a wine shop run by Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese They are rough characters and in the underground revolution that is brewing When Ernest leads them up to the room Manette is kept in they see a hole in the wall He tells them that he lets people watch the man The find Manette making shoes

They can see that Manettes mind is still in prison where he has spent the last 18 years of his life When they ask him his name he says his cell number But as Lucie approaches Manette notices her blond hair He relates that he has a blond lock in a small bag hanging from his neck He had taken it with him to recall happier times The blond hair from his wife is a perfect match to Lucies She wants to take her father away immediately but Lorry cautions the damage such a trip might do to Manettes already precarious health She insists his health and sanity would not improve in Paris Ernest Defarge agrees with her so they leave for England

Five years later we find Tellsons Bank ready to check up on Manette The bank is a dark and depressing place especially because of its location near where until recently heads of criminals were put on display by the government after execution Jerry Cruncher and his son little Jerry wait outside the bank ready to run messages and errands for the bankers They send him to the Old Bailey Courthouse to await any messages from Lorry who is there for the case against Charles Darnay Accused with divulging secret information to the King of France Darnay is on trial for treason against the crown His defense attorney Mr Stryver cross examines two men who have come to testify against Darnay John Barsad and Roger Cly He quickly discredits their testimonies because they are disreputable men Then the prosecution calls Mr Lorry up to the stand to say whether Darnay was on the coach with him from London to Dover from the beginning of the book Mr Lorry says he cant be sure as everyone was bundled up with their heads covered Then the prosecution calls Lucie up to the stand She recounts that Darnay was on the ship with her coming back from Paris He helped her tend to her father Her testimony helps Darnay until she relates that he said Washington would be as famous as the King

Next they call her father to the stand He looks very respectable now but he doesnt help either side as he was too ill to notice anything or anyone The jury is still on the fence until they notice Stryvers assistant attorney Sidney Carton hand a note to him Stryver points out that it can be hard to point out the identity of someone years later even his assistant Carton could be mistaken for Darnay They find Darnay innocent As they are leaving the courthouse Darnay praises Stryver for his defense and thanks Lucie and her father for testifying From the shadows Carton emerges Hes been drinking and bemoaning his fate He has no family or any one who cares about him or he cares about The problems Darnay faced would be worth it for the attention of someone as wonderful as Lucie He would like to change places with his lookalike Carton is well educated brilliant man but he lacks a purpose He is idle with no ambition Lorry has become a regular fixture in the Manette home He converses with Miss Pross on the many suitors Lucie has including we find Darnay and Carton Of course Miss Pross doesnt think any of the suitors are worthy of Lucie The only man she thinks might be good enough is her brother Solomon But he has come to some bad luck Lorry knows Solomon is not a good person He robbed his sister then disappeared
The next chapter opens in Paris The Marquis St Evremonde is at a party given by the Monseigneur a lord of the royal French court The party is extravagant and the Monseigneur is a pompous selfimportant reprobate He has three servants to help him drink his chocolate When the Monseigneur snubs the Marquis he is furious Leaving in a huff he has his carriage driven fast and recklessly through the city streets enjoying everyone rushing to get out of the way Suddenly the coach stops he has mowed down a little boy Unfeelingly the Marquis is only worried about his coach and doesnt care at all about the death of a little boy He throws the father a coin just as another man comes up It is Ernest Defarge the wine shop merchant He tells the father that at least his son died happy instead spending his life in the unhappiness his position in France would give him The Marquis calls Defarge a philosopher and throws him a coin too As the Marquis is leaving a coin is thrown back into his carriage He is incensed saying that he would kill all of the peasants if it was up to him

As he travels on to his own land more and more despair is prevalent He asks a man who is staring at his coach what he is looking at The man says he saw someone hanging on to the Marquis carriage He scoffs at him as well as the woman begging him to put a marker on her husbands grave The Marquis rushes into his stately manor inquiring of the servants if his nephew Charles has arrived yet from England

Charles Darnay is his nephew When he arrives later that night Darnay says he wants nothing to do with the title and plans to denounce it when his uncle dies Darnay believes the title is linked to misery The people under the Marquis have been treated shamefully and he doesnt want to link his future to such a title The next morning the Marquis is found stabbed in his bed with a note attached that read Drive him fast to his tomb This from Jacques During the French revolution the resistance identified each other by the name Jacques

After a year has passed we find Darnay making a moderate living as a French teacher in England His courtship of Lucie has progressed to the point where he feels safe to discuss his love of her with her father He tells Manette his true name isnt Darnay and offers to confess his name But Manette stops him if his wishes come true Darnay can tell him on his wedding day That same evening Stryver and Carton are working together in Stryvers apartment Stryver tells Carton he plans on proposing to Lucie Carton says he doesnt care but he proceeds to get drunk Stryver suggests that Carton find an nice woman with some property and get married too Otherwise he will end up poor and alone
When Stryver does plan on making his big proposal he firsts stops at the bank to tell Lorry He advises Stryver to wait until he can find out where the wind blows with Lucies affections and Stryvers chances of an acceptance The two men meet later and Lorry tells Stryder that if he had proposed she would have said no Stryver is angry considering Lucie a vain idiot He asks Lorry to forget he ever thought about asking her

Meanwhile Carton comes across Lucie in his regular nightly wanderings He tells her of his wasted life She thinks her friendship could save him and urges him to make his life important Although not admitting his love for her he says he would do anything for her even give his own life He doesnt feel he deserves her love but her pity will do

The next scene involves Jerry Cruncher He comes across a funeral procession for Roger Cly It erupts into a great party as people mock Clys reputation as a false accuser That night Jerry tells his wife he is going fishing But actually he is going to dig up Clys body Jerrys son follows him where he discovers his father is a resurrectionman He unearths bodies and sells them to science Little Jerry wants to do that for a living when he grows up

In Paris the revolution is simmering and ready to boil The Defarges are having regular meetings in the room Manette stayed in while in their wine shop Mrs Defarge is knitting She knits in the names of all the aristocrats the resistance intends to execute They find out there is a spy living among them John Barsad He visits the wine shop thinking they dont know who he is and tells them that the daughter of Alexander Manette is going to marry Charles Darnay the nephew of the late Marquis After he leaves Mrs Defarge knits Darnays name in even though it saddens her husband who was a devoted servant to Manette

Finally Lucie and Darnays wedding day arrives He goes into a private room with Manette who emerges afterwards pale and trembling While the couple go away for their honeymoon Manette stays with Jarvis Lorry He notices Manette retreating into a depression He is at his shoemakers bench again But on the tenth day when the honeymooners are due home Manette leaves his bench behind and seems much better Miss Pross and Lorry convince Manette to allow them to destroy his shoemakers bench so he wont be tempted to fall into the pattern again The first visitor of the newlyweds is Carton He apologizes for his drunkenness during Darnays trial and asks to become a more frequent visitor if they can stand him After he leaves Darnay is reluctant but gives into Lucie who wants to help Carton

Five years progress The world is changing Lucie and Darnay have children A little girl named Lucie and a boy that dies young Lorry notices many of the French people are transporting their wealth to England
Meanwhile in Paris at the Bastille Defarge his wife and their group of revolutionist storm the prison Defarge demands to be shown to Manettes cell When he comes back he sees his wife cutting off the head of the guard The violence continues to escalate They torch the home of the late Marquis The group finds a wealthy man named Foulon who tried to hide in the country Since he had said the poor could eat grass if they are starving they fill his mouth with grass after hanging him and cutting off his head Afterwards the group goes home to play with their children and make love

Three years pass and the violence in France is still stirring Lorrys boss wants him to go there and retrieve the papers from their branch in Paris before they are destroyed Darnay tries to dissuade him from going but its Lorrys job He says he will bring Jerry Cruncher along as a body guard Suddenly Lorry receives a letter addressed to the Marquis St Evremonde Darnay convinces Lorry that he knows the Marquis and can get the letter to him When Darnay sees the letter is from a faithful servant of his uncles who is in trouble with the revolutionists he makes plans to go to France to help the man He leaves a note for Lucie and Dr Manette

Darnay is quickly arrested and put in solitary confinement in the jail known as La Force Meanwhile Lucie Manette and Miss Pross head to Paris to rescue Darnay Going straight to see Lorry at the bank they beg for his help getting Darnay out of La Force Manette tells Lorry he wants to use his status as a former prisoner of Bastille to help his soninlaw Lorry shows him the people sharpening tools outside the window They plan to kill the prisoners of La Force Manette runs out into the middle of the group asking for their help

Lorry takes Lucie her daughter and Miss Pross to a house for safekeeping He sets Jerry Cruncher as guard Back at the bank Defarge brings a message from Manette to Lorry Following Manettes instructions Lorry takes Defarge to where Lucie is staying Defarge brings his wife so she can also protect Lucie After reading a note from her husband asking her to have courage Lucie begs Mrs Defarge to spare her husband But she responds with the comment that the revolution will stop for no one including Lucie and her family

Marnette returns with a new strength He has seen Darnay and has persuaded the tribunal to spare him Marnette has also arranged to be the physician for three prisons so he can keep an eye on Darnay For a year and three months Darnay stays in prison Each day Lucie stands in the street in view of a window that Darnay can see her from Even through the terrors around her she remains One day her father arrives to tell her the next day is her husbands trial and he knows it will turn out well

At his trial Darnay does fare well The testimonies of Lucie Manette the martyr of the people and Gabelle the man Darnay came to France to help all come together to get his aquittal Gabelle testifies that long before the revolution Darnay relinquished his title because he didnt agree the treatment of people by his uncle The crowd of revolutionists applaud Darnay and carry him out on their shoulders The next day soldiers come to arrest Darnay again When Manette asks them who accuses him the soldier replies that it is Defarge and his wife and one other person Manette will be told the identity of the other accuser Things dont look promising

While this is happening Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher come across her brother posing as Solomon Cruncher recognizes him from Darnays trial in England but cant remember the name he used Suddenly Carton appears and says its Barsad and he is a spy Carton has been laying low in case he was needed but having heard Solomon speaking of the arrest of Darnay he knows the time is now Carton threatens to reveal Barsads true identity if he doesnt go to the bank with him to see Lorry When they reach Lorry Carton lets Barsard know that if he doesnt help him with a plan to free Darnay he will reveal him to the revolutionaries and tell them he saw him talking to Cly a well known British spy Barsad contends that Cly is dead but Cruncher retorts that the casket Cly was supposed to be in was full of rocks Cartons plan involves a stop by a pharmacists where he reminisces about his childhood priest and the lessons he was taught about life after death He is at peace with his decision

Darnay is on trial again His accusers are named the Dr Manette and the Defarges Manette denies ever making an accusation against his soninlaw But Ernest Defarge produces the letter he found in Manettes cell The letter reveals the actions of the Marquis St Evremonde Darnays father and uncle Manette was called to tend to a girl dying of a fever and her brother who was dying of a stab wound Manette was unable to save the girl She had been brutally raped by Darnays uncle who also stabbed her brother and killed her husband The next day Darnays mother came to find the girls little sister so as to help her and keep her safe but she could not be found Then the Marquis and his brother came to see Manette He wouldnt take it so he was tossed into Bastille for 18 years While there he wrote a letter explaining what happened and cursing the Marquis and all his prodigy After hearing this the jury sentenced Darnay to the guillotine to pay for his father and uncles sins

The same crowd who had hailed Darnay the day before now roared against him as he is escorted back to prison Darnay urges Manette to not blame himself for the outcome Banard who is charged with taking him to prison allows one last embrace between Darnay and Lucie Carton tells Manette to try one last time to change the mind of the persecutors while he assists Lucie back home He also asks Manette to meet him at the bank afterward

As this is happening Miss Pross is getting the rest of their belongings together Mrs Defarge arrives hoping to find Lucie mourning the upcoming death of her husband a prisoner It is illegal and she hopes to pile it on top of other made up charges in order to executed her and her daughter But she meets with Miss Pross who has sent Cruncher down to the carriage so they wont be seen leaving at the same time Miss Pross and Mrs Defarge fight Mrs Defarge pulls a gun and it accidentally goes off killing Mrs Defarge and deafening Miss Pross

20,Pi'nin Yaşamı,"The book begins with an authors note The author writes himself into the story and claims to be a novelist who was told an incredible story while living in India He is now trying to shed the failure of his most recent novel and is currently living in India while attempting to write a book about Portugal The author talks to a man named Francis who says that he can get him in touch with a man named Pi Patel who he says will tell him a story so incredible that it will make him believe in God The author agrees and meets with Patel in Canada He then goes on to briefly discussed the experience of hearing Patels story and why he decided to write it as a novel He expresses great love and affection for Patel

Chapter 1 begins with Pi narrating in the first person and telling the reader that his suffering has left him sad and gloomy However he does not reveal how he has suffered but goes on to explain that he was a religious and zoological student He says that he is working and now lives in Canada although he misses his home country of India and also misses someone named Richard Parker

In the beginning of chapter 2 the narrative switches back to the authors point of view for a description of Pi He is a small slim man  no more than five foot five Dark hair dark eyes Hair graying at the temples Cant be older than forty The narrator also says that Pi has a Pleasing coffeecolored complexion and an Expressive face

In Chapter 3 the narration switches back to Pi as he remembers his childhood in India Pi tells the author that he was named after a pool which was quite odd since his parents could not swim He learned to swim himself from a friend of the family Francis The pool he was named after was called the Piscine Molitor in Paris France As a child Pi was teased relentlessly because his name Piscine sounded like pissing Thereafter he asked to be referred to simply as Pi

Pis father ran a zoo called Pondicherry Zoo and it was from there that Pi developed a love for animals However the zoo has since been shut down Pi also remembers his school days the teachers he had as a child and his favorite teacher a man named Satish Kumar Mr Kumar is an atheist and the first one that Pi ever met He felt that he had a great spiritual kinship with Mr Kumar Pi relates that he does not mind atheists in general but agnostics who he feels are filled with doubt and indecision are repulsive to him

Pi begins to talk about animals again and discusses a memory of when his father fed a live goat to a tiger at the zoo in front of him and his brother in order to teach them a lesson about the dangers of being around wild animals He talks about the territorial nature of wild animals and explains that while animals are violently defensive of their preferred area they also respect the territory of other animals Wild animals who are taken care of in a zoo will rarely attempt to break out On the rare occasion that they do it is most often because they feel that another animal has invaded their territory Animals have more to gain from a good relationship with us than we do with them

The author takes over the narration again and notes all of the religious iconographies in Pis house Pi also keeps a copy of the Bible on his bedside table Pi tells him that he was born into Hinduism but that one day when he was fourteen he came across a Catholic church and decided to go inside A man named Father Martin told him the story of the Bible and this convinced Pi to become a Christian Then a year later Pi became a Muslim after meeting a baker who reminded him of Mr Kumar Pi says that one day a priest pandit and imam approached him and were embarrassed to discover that Pi didnt exclusively belong to any of their religions The men insisted that this was not acceptable and demanded that he choose between their religions
Pi merely insists that he just wants to love God

During the nineteen seventies India becomes very politically uncomfortable for Pis father and he decided to move their entire family to Canada He sold off many of the zoo animals and arranged to bring some of them along on the ship with his family Pi says that his mother was very nervous about leaving everything she knew behind but that he was very excited

The author narrates again telling the reader that he was surprised to find out that Pi was married and meet his wife Meena and his two children Nikhil and Usha Pi then describes introducing Mr Kumar his teacher with his counterpart the Muslim baker Pi brought them to the zoo and showed them a zebra Both were impressed by the odd animal Pi then discusses the theory of zoomorphism which is when an animal in captivity begins to see another animal or even a human as one of its own kind He insists that the animals know that it is not true that the animal is not one of them but they go along with the fiction in order to maintain their security
At the beginning of part two were taken on the boat with Pis family to Canada Pi is sleeping when he hears a loud noise like an explosion He wakes up and attempts to wake his brother Ravi so that they can go discover the source of the noise but Ravi does not want to wake up Pi ascends to the main deck alone and sees that the ship is listing to one side and filling with water He tries to run back down to his parents cabin but when he returns to the stairwell it is already filled with water Pi hears animals bellowing from below as three crewman put a life jacket on him and throw him overboard to save him He falls and lands on a lifeboat forty feet below but a Zebra jumps onto the boat as well and causes it to fall into the water

The ship sinks Pi says that it Made a sound like a monstrous metallic burp Things bubbled at the surface and then vanished Pi ends up on a lifeboat alone and in the chaos he spys a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker in the water and shouts at the animal Richard Parker in an effort to save himself jumps onto the small lifeboat with Pi This frightens Pi who jumps back into the water so that he will not be in such close proximity to such a dangerous animal

A shark cuts through the water near Pi and he hoists himself up onto an oar that is hanging off the edge of the ship The ship sinks and sinks until it completely disappears No one else but Pi survives Pi realizes that he must get back onto the lifeboat and climbs back on Only the zebra is visible and Pi assumes that Richard Parker is hiding under the tarp covering one side of the boat Pi notices that the zebra has a badly broken leg Soon a hyena reveals itself on the boat and Pi assumes that this means that the tiger must have jumped off at some point because it would have killed the hyena by now if it hadnt Pi is afraid of the hyena as well but decides that he prefers it to the tiger An orangutan that was named Orange Juice who was once a big draw at his fathers zoo floats up on a different raft She climbs onto the lifeboat as well and Pi thinks that she in shock

On the first night in the boat Pi worries that other rescue boats will not be able to see him but feels confident that word of the ships sinking would have gone out In the morning he discovers that the hyena has bitten off the zebras broken leg and is eating it The zebra is still alive but struggling Pi notices that Orange Juice appears to be looking for her two babies in the water and that he has been looking for his family the same way He realizes that he is in shock The hyena attacks the zebra and devours it alive Blood spills into the water and sharks begin to circle the boat Pi worries that they will break the hull and sink it However they do not and soon swim away Pi must listen to the hyena eating the zebra over the course of the rest of the day He wonders if Orange Juice will be able to fight off the hyena if it descends on her as well Soon the hyena does attack Orange Juice and consumes her as wellShortly after this the tiger Richard Parker crawls out from under the tarp and attacks the hyena killing it
Shortly after this the tiger Richard Parker crawls out from under the tarp and attacks the hyena killing it At this point Pi tells the author that the tigers name Richard Parker was the result of a clerical error during his sale that accidentally mixed up the tigers name with the name of the man who was selling him Originally Richard Parker was named Thirsty because when he was caught he was with his mother at a watering hole Pi begins to realize that he must find fresh water to drink if hes going to survive He finds a box of emergency supplies under the tarp Also in the locker are 31 packages of rations Pi also decides that in order to survive on a lifeboat with Richard Parker he will need to put some distance between him and the tiger He begins to build a raft out of oars life jackets and a lifebuoy and attaches it to the boat

Pi manages to escape onto the raft but realizes that he is now floating on a small raft over an endless ocean with sharks swimming around underneath him He thinks that he will merely outlive Richard Parker by waiting for him to dehydrate but remembers that tigers can drink seawater with no ill effects In this way Richard Parker may outlive him as he has the whole ocean to drink As Pi contemplates Richard Parker the tiger makes a rare growl that Pi recognizes as a noise that his kind make when they have no ill intentions Pi suddenly decides to try and tame Richard Parker He takes a whistle from one of the life jackets and shouts at the tiger to prove that he is the alpha

Pi soon gets thirsty and hungry enough to return to the life boat He finds a survivors manual teaching him how to catch fish and a few solar stills that are capable of turning salt water into fresh water He hangs a blanket over the raft to protect from the sun As a lifelong vegetarian Pi struggles with killing fish to feed himself but eventually manages to do so and feeds Richard Parker as well Pi pours some of the water from the solar stills into a bucket for Richard Parker At the end of the day he realizes that it has now been one week since the ship sunkOver Pis

Over Pis narration we are told he spent 227 days at sea with Richard Parker in the life boat Pi relates that he kept sane only by forgetting the notion of time He spent his days doing certain activities like writing praying and resting and chores to maintain the boat and take care of Richard Parker

Over time his clothes fell apart and he began to get boils from the constant dampness He gets to be very adept at fishing and even catches sea turtles He also spent his time training the tiger using a turtle shell as a shield One day a large dorado fish leaps onto the boat and Pi manages to grab it Richard Parker sees the fish and tries to eat it but Pi stares him down until the trained tiger backs away After this Pi throws the tiger part of the catch as a reward

Soon a large storm moves in on the boat and Pi must hide under the tarp with Richard Parker The storm continues for one night and one day while the ship crests waves that are the size of mountains When the storm is over Pi comes out from under the tarp to see that the raft that he has been spending most of his time on to stay away from Richard Parker is gone and the life boat itself has taken some damage Pi begins to mend the tarp and bail water from the boat and even finds the whistle that he used to train Richard Parker
Days later a large shipping tanker appears on the horizon and Pi is sure that he will be saved However the tanker can not see the small life boat and nearly runs it over Pis boat manages to float into a mass of trash and Pi catches a clear glass bottle and traps a message in it Hes health begins to deteriorate He begins sleeping for most of the day and soon goes blind In his delirium he hears a voice with a French accent and begins to think that he is speaking to Richard Parker However soon he realizes that the voice actually belongs to another castaway on another boat The man boards Pis boat in order to kill and cannibalize him but sensing his intentions Richard Parker attacks and kills the man before he can do so Pi cries and washes his eyes out with water and soon his vision returnsEventually the life boat runs across a small island covered with algae Richard Parker and Pi stop the boat and nurse themselves back to health by eating the plants on the island and drinking the fresh water

Eventually the life boat runs across a small island covered with algae Richard Parker and Pi stop the boat and nurse themselves back to health by eating the plants on the island and drinking the fresh water Pi stays on the island for a while but soon begins to notice that it has some flaws All of the fresh ponds are filled with dead fish and when Pi finds a fruit tree he finds that at the center of every fruit is a human tooth Pi deliriously assumes that the island is carnivorous and restocks the life boat waiting for Richard Parker to board before pushing off again

The boat makes it to shore on a Mexican beach Pi lays down on the sand and Richard Parker runs off into the jungle Pi is upset by the loss of the tiger that he has come to see as a comrade and regrets that he didnt get to say goodbye Strangers find Pi and bring him to the hospital where they begin to restore his health Two officials from the Japanese Maritime department travel to Mexico to interview Pi about the sinking of the ship which was from their country The full transcript of the interview is presented to the reader in part three Pi tells the men the story of his journey and they find it interesting but hard to believe The men tells Pi that Richard Parker has not been found around the city and he protests that wild animals are very good at hiding even in developed areas

The two men tell Pi that they want to know what really happened and Pi makes up a story about being on the lifeboat with his mother the ships cook and a sailor He says that the sailor has a broken leg and that the cook eventually turned to cannibalism and killed both the sailor and his mother Pi eventually had to stop the cook by killing him himself In this way all four animals who were originally on in Pis first version of the story the zebra with the broken leg the hyena the orangutan and the tiger are represented as humans

After he finishes this story he asks the men which story they liked better They begin to ask more questions about the second story but Pi doesnt know anything about why the ship sunk and cannot help them Both men agree that the story with the tiger was a better story Years later one of the men sends a report to the author and tells him of Pis tiger story"

23,Beyaz Diş,"
Zadie Smith prefaces White Teeth with the following quote What is past is prologue Inscription in Washington DC museum This statement sets the thematic mood for the novel in which three different families of mixed ethnicity struggle with issues of heritage and legacy Some characters such as Samad cling to the past obsessively while others such as Magid attempt to reject it The preface suggests that the past is inescapable and encourages attention to details By letting the wise words of the past speak before her Smith acknowledges that What is past is prologue applies to writers as well Thus the ideas she examines in the next 500 pages have developed out of her own personal consideration of the past In that sense the preface credits all the authors who have inspired Smith to write this her first novel

The novels main story spans the years 1975 to 2000 but in a flashback reaches as far back as 1907 and beyond In the style of hysterical realism Smith cuts between incidents points of view and eras with movielike deftness weaving these disparate stories into one narrative In Smiths novel past is not just prologue as the preface suggests but is sometimes barely distinguishable from the present

White Teeth is set mainly in Willesden North London On New Years Day 1975 Alfred Archibald Jones Archie attempts to gas himself to death in his car The butcher Mo HusseinIshmael saves Archie and for the first time in his life he feels worthwhile In his new spirit of enthusiasm Archie joins an End of the World party at a commune where he meets Clara Bowden a gorgeous and captivating Jamaican woman who is missing her upper teeth Although Archie is twice Claras age the two wed soon after this first meeting

Smith takes us to Claras teenage years when she was an awkward and unattractive Jehovahs Witness She strayed from her religion when she began dating a boy named Ryan Topps Ironically Ryan eventually became a Jehovahs Witness and tried to win Clara back to the Church While riding on his scooter they crashed into a tree knocking out Claras upper teeth

In 1975 Archie and Clara are married as Samad and Alsana Iqbal look on Samad and Archie met when they served together in World War II and are best friends Samad works at an Indian restaurant and Alsana sews clothing for an SM shop Because of racial differences the Iqbals and Joness are unlikely friends Clara soon becomes pregnant with a daughter Irie and Alsana becomes pregnant with twin boys Magid and Millat Soon both women realize that they know very little about their older husbands

In the present Irie Magid and Millat attend the same elementary school Samad takes overzealous control of his sons educations demanding changes at every governers meeting note that the British spelling is governer rather than the American governor After one meeting Samad meets the childrens music teacher Poppy BurtJones and is attracted to her immediately Samad pursues a relationship with her until one day Magid and Millat catch him with her He decides that the only way to make sure his sons grow up to be honorable traditional men is to send them to Bangladesh However a lack of funds forces him to choose only one son to send away He kidnaps Magid with Archies help and sends him to be raised with his family in Bangladesh When Alsana discovers his actions she resolves never to give Samad a straight answer to another question

Time passes and the children enter their teenage years Letters from Magid show that he continues to be a precocious thoughtful boy In one letter Magid mentions he broke his nose Samad taunts Millat whom he thinks is a goodfornothing saying that now the brothers look different as well as being different Millat laughs so hard that he trips and breaks his own nose During a terrible hurricane the Iqbals flee to the Joness supposedly weatherproof house When a tree crashes through the roof the adults scramble to resecure the house while Irie and Millat sneak out to go walking in the storm

The year is 1990 In her desire to attract Millat the now fullfigured Irie attempts to have her hair straightened However the procedure burns off all of her hair She gets fake hair to replace it but it rips out of her head Irie goes looking for Millat at Glenard Oak School to warn him about the new Raid Committee against marijuana When Millat dismisses her she walks away with his joint and stops to talk to a nerd named Joshua Chalfen Millat comes upon them just as Irie is passing the joint to Joshua They all get caught by the Raid Committee and as punishment are forced to study together twice a week at Joshuas house At the Chalfens Millat becomes the pet project of Joshuas mother Joyce Chalfen an extremely nurturing horticulturalist Irie becomes friends with Joshuas father Marcus Chalfen a genetic engineer preparing to present a project called FutureMouse in which he has altered a mouses genes so that it develops certain cancers at specific times in its life Meanwhile Alsana and Clara worry that their children spend too much time with the Chalfens However the childrens grades improve so much that the Iqbals and Joness throw a party Clara goes to the Chalfens house to thank Joyce who rudely asserts that Iries intellect could not come from her parents In shock Clara says it must come from her own grandfather Captain Charlie Durham She regrets this as soon as she says it because in her words he was really a nogood djam fool bwoy

35,Zor Yıllar,"Hard Times opens in an empty school room Three men are discussing the importance of education for young children The importance of facts and facts alone in education is under discussion while the children watch quietly waiting to have facts poured into them until they were full to the brim Mr Thomas Gradgrind has established a model school in the small industrial town of Coketown His school will teach nothing but the facts to children He doesnt want any imagination Not fairy tales or adventure stories While he is explaining his method of teaching to his newest teacher Mr McChoakumchild Mr Gradgrind decides to quiz the children as an example of his methods He asks girl number twenty to define a horse She is new so he doesnt know her name just her number When he asks her what her name is she replies that it is Sissy Jupe Mr Gradgrind admonishes her for using a nickname When she tells him it is what her father calls her he asks what her father does She says her father belongs to the horseriding He further corrects her by saying he must break horses Fearful of correcting her teacher she agrees then he goes on to say that the man doctors sick horses so he must be a veterinary surgeon

After reminding her that she is Cecelia Jupe he asks her again to define a horse When she is too alarmed to answer he announces to the children that Girl number twentynis unable to define a horse” Then he throws the question over to a little boy Blitzer He has cold eyes and unwholesome skin But his definition is only facts quadruped forty teeth etc Sissy embarrassed sits down Later while walking home Mr Gradgrind sees his two oldest children peeking through a hole in the fence at the circus He is furious Mr Gradgrind trained all of his own children since birth to deal with only facts and to not indulge in any entertainment But here is his oldest daughter sixteenyearold Louisa and her younger brother Thomas staring at the circus for entertainment Louisa tries to defend her brother by saying she pulled him there But when Mr Gradgrind pulls them away he then asks them what Mr Bounderby would say if he could see them

Mr Bounderby is a friend of Mr Gradgrinds He is boastful and coarse but wealthy which is why everyone admires him He is at this time in the Gradgrinds parlor bragging about his impoverished childhood He blusters about it often his mother abandoned him in a ditch he was raised by an alcoholic grandmother beaten starved barely clothed etcHe is just getting into his favorite topic with the sickly Mrs Gradgrind while blocking the heat from her fire when Mr Gradgrind comes in pulling his children along Mr Gradgrind proceeds to tell his friend about their misbehavior expecting him to join in his admonishments But Mr Bounderby just half heartily speaks to them and then tells them to go and study

Mr Bounderby theorizes that little Miss Jupe may be the cause of leading the children astray Mr Gradgrind agrees with him and the two decide to tell her father that she is no longer welcome at the school But before he leaves Mr Bounderby makes a quick stop in the nursery to see Louisa He tells her he has redirected her fathers anger and wants a kiss in payment She allows him to kiss her on the cheek but is obviously disgusted by him
Mr Gradgrind and Mr Bounderby take off for the circus Along the way the see Sissy Jupe being chased by Blitzer The two men stop the bullying and accompany the girl back to her father who had sent her out to get horse liniment

When the trio reaches the hotel the circus performers are all staying in she learns that her father had lost his ability to perform and had left abandoning her Mr Gradgrind feels compassion for her and agrees to take her home with him He plans to educate her in the same method he did his own children Without imagination only facts She agrees only because she believes her father will be back for her The circus master agrees to tell him where to find her if he does

The next day Bounderby is discussing Sissy with his housekeeper Mrs Sparsit Mrs Sparsit is from an aristocratic family that has fallen on hard times She is employed by Mr Bounderby but never lets him forget about her lofty family Since Mr Bounderby has already staked out young Louisa as his future wife he is concerned that Sissy may be a bad influence

Meanwhile Mr Gradgrind has informed Sissy that she will still be attending his school and she will help out his wife while at home This is all against the advice of Mr Bounderby but Mr Gradgrind likes to experiment with young minds Louisa is not happy Her world at the Stone Lodge is colorless Her little brother Tom is also unhappy but neither of them can quite put their finger on what is missing Her mother warns Louisa against wondering about anything Her father thinks it is fanciful to wonder about things She should gather facts and then know

Little Miss Jupe is having trouble at school Studying just the cold hard facts is too difficult Her mind wanders away quite often and she worries about her father Mr Gradgrind admonishes her to stay to the facts and not think about her father who may never come back But Louisa finds her fascinating Louisa has been steered away from any strong emotions all her life and she finds Sissys ability to express emotions wonderfully During her talks with Sissy Tom often reminds her to be careful Mr Bounderby wont like her wondering about Sissys past"

38,Yeraltından Notlar,"The anonymous storyteller of Notes from Underground is a misanthropic and bitter man who lives alone in the 1860s in the town of St Petersburg Russia He is a Russian civil service veteran who retired after getting an inheritance The novel is made of the notes written by the man a contradictory and confused set of confessions or memoirs that describe and explain his alienation from the Russian modern society

Notes from Underground has two sections The first section entitled Underground is shorter than the second one and the action takes place in the 1860s The Underground Man is forty years old This part is an introduction to his character and explains his theories and his hostile position towards the Russian society The first thing the Underground Man says is that he is a sick man    a wicked man    an unattractive man He tells the readers that he is neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect He is a very intelligent and wellread man who believes that this is the cause of his misery

The Underground Man believes that in a modern society all educated and conscious men should be as disconsolate as he is He has grown disillusioned with the whole philosophy He appreciates the sublime the Romantic idea of beautiful and lofty but knows how absurd this is in the context of his mundane and petty existence The Underground Man disdains 19thcentury utilitarianism the school of thought attempting to use logical proofs and mathematical formulas to align the desires of mans with his interests The Underground Man protests that primary desire of man is to use his free will irrespective of whether it is in his best interest or not

Faced to utilitarianism man can do unproductive and ugly things merely to prove that you cannot predict free will so it is totally free This explains in part why the Underground Mans insists that he likes his liver pains or toothaches as a manner of spiting lifes predictability in modern society who accepts without questioning the value of seeing a doctor

The Underground Man is however not very proud of this futile behaviour He despises himself as a human being Can a man possessing consciousness ever really respect himself he asks the reader He knows that he is so defeated by inertia that he cant become wicked as much as he should be a rascal or unimportant enough to be an insect or as lazy as he should be a true lounger

The second part of Notes from Underground called Apropos of the Wet Snow practically illustrates the abstract ideas set forth by the Underground Man in the first section This part describes the Underground Mans progression from his inexperienced perspective influenced by the beautiful and lofty and Romanticism to his more mature point of view in 1860 full of cynicism about loftiness beauty and essentially literariness

Apropos of the Wet Snow presents interactions between the narrator and different people who live in his world prostitutes soldiers former schoolmates The Underground Man is very withdrawn from these people so he is totally unable to have a normal relationship with them He treats them with a combo of fear and disgust that results in his humiliation which then results in selfloathing and remorse

The alienation of the Underground Mans can be seen in all types of relationships When he is having a walk in the park he gets obsessed about yielding the right of way to an unknown soldier who had been kicked out of the bar because he had been fighting The Underground Man enters the bar believing that he can get into a fight He gets into an officers way on purpose but the officer pushes him aside without a word not looking at him

He wants to challenge the officer to a duel but afterwards realizes that all the people would laugh at him for talking about honour in literary Russian So he goes home and he then sees the officer often around St Petersburg He writes him a letter but doesnt send it to him He frequently sees the officer on a certain street and all the time gets out of his way when they nearly walk into each other Afterwards he wants to bump into the officer but not move out of his way in order to defy him He borrows some money from his head of the office to buy smart clothes for their encounter He tries to walk into the officer but keeps getting out of the way in the last minute He eventually bumps into the officer but the officer does not see the Underground Man He is convinced that the officer was only pretending not to see him so he feels avenged for everything
But soon his happiness wears off and he escapes from his depression in his dreams about all that was beautiful and sublime He dreams for three months that he is a hero like one of Lord Byrons works and everybody loves him Then in a strange attempt to have social interaction the protagonist follows on purpose some of his school acquaintances to dinner but he is not welcome they treat him like some sort of ordinary house fly so he alternates between openly insulting them and craving their friendship and attention
Later that evening the Underground Man tries to rescue a beautiful young prostitute whose name is Liza through sentimental and passionate speeches about the horrible fate she will have if she goes on selling her body He tells Liza the story of a dead prostitute who was being carried in a coffin he saw earlier that day and describes the ugly life of a prostitute They speak about marriage and families and the Underground Man tells her to go away from the brothel saying that the married life is pure bliss He tells her that if she goes on with her life as a prostitute she will certainly lose everything beauty youth health and hope and will end up dead so nobody will remember her She cries then the Underground Man invites her home and gives her his address

She does not come for a few days and the Underground Man describes Apollon his servant as being disobedient and arrogant One day he tries to force Apollon to beg for his wage but he just stares at the Underground Man until he snaps and asks Apollon to show him some respect before getting his money

Several days later when Liza comes to visit the Underground Man in his shoddy apartment he reacts in anger and shame when he understands that she has reasons to look down or pity him The Underground Man keeps insulting Liza during her visit He says to her that he does not pity her and asks her to leave him alone She embraces him then he bursts into hysterical tears
When he recovers the Underground Man cannot return any affection to her and tells her to leave him alone in peace and quiet When Liza is getting ready to leave he out of spite slips money into her hand but Liza refuses to take it Confused and hurt she leaves him in his apartment and goes away He runs after her and dreams how he would fall down before her sob with remorse kiss her feet and beg her forgiveness but does not follow her anymore He tells the readers that he has not seen her ever since and feels ashamed about his notes

At this point the Underground Man ends the notes At the end of the novel in a footnote Dostoevsky indicates that the Underground Man failed to make even the simple decision of stop writing because Dostoevsky claims that the Notes manuscript has many pages after the point at which he chose to end it"
39,Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık,"If we start in a chronological order the novel begins with the foundation of the town Macondo It was founded by Jose Arcadio Buendia and his friends They established it after years of wandering the jungle in search of the sea He decided to leave his hometown after he committed a murder and now he was haunted by a ghost of the man he had killed

Two families Buendias and Iguarans – the family of Arkadios wife Ursula were tied up with business and private affairs Jose and Ursula decided to get married despite the fact that their parents scared them with stories of not being able to deliver children They told them that they will have iguanas instead of children The fact that Ursulas aunt gave birth to a boy with a pigs tail did not help their case

Macondo was in the middle of the jungle and had no links to the outer world It became a working and neat little town Soon it was found by gypsies led by Melquiades The gypsies visited them once a year and brought them new inventions such as the magnet or ice

Jose Arcadio was amazed by the things they used to bring that he started researching and tried to discover new things Melquiades sold him an alchemists laboratory With time Jose Arcadio and Melquiades became close friends After many years of travel Melquiades came to live with Jose Arcadio He brought parchments with an unknown writing on them He claimed that the secret of the parchments will reveal when the time is right

Soon after the gypsies new people started arriving They opened up new shops in the town The town was developing fast and the government started to gain interest in it They send a messenger to check out the town Jose Arcadio let him stay as long as he promised to not interfere with their business

Jose Arcadio was occupied with his findings and his wife took care of the house and kids They home soon became one of the prettiest homes in town

The first born son was named Jose Arcadio II He inherited his fathers impulsivity and strength He got involved with Pilar Ternera and she was a fortune teller She got pregnant and then Jose Arcadio II left her and joined the gypsies His mother Ursula took care of the child

New people kept arriving and one of them was Rebeca She was an orphan and her parents wanted Buendias to take care of her Ursula treated her like a daughter She raised her as one of her own next to her daughter Amaranta When they grew up both of them fell in love with Pietro Crespi He was a young Italian salesman

He chose Rebeca to be his fiancée and Amaranta swore that shell stop the weeding
Joses and Ursulas younger son colonel Aureliano inherited his fathers love for mystic things He had an affair with his brothers girlfriend Pilar and they had a son together He was called Aureliano Jose He also felt love for the commanders daughter Remedios

Remedios was so young that they had to hold off the weeding until she hit puberty Despite her years she was very mature a loving and carrying wife and she also took care of Aurelians son She got pregnant with twins and during the pregnancy she died

Jose Arcadio II came back to the town and he claimed to have been traveling the seas When he saw Rebeca a spark appeared and they fell in love Rebeca soon left Pietro and she married Jose Arcadio II When they decided to get married Ursula disowned them because they wanted to get married while everyone was grieving about Remedios They decided to move into a new home After Rebeca got married Amaranta decided to reject every man who asks to marry her even Pietro and he committed suicide after she turned him down

Soon a civil war started and lasted for approximately 20 years Macondo sent an army led by Colonel Aureliano Buendia and they were supposed to fight the conservatives While the Colonel was away Jose Arcadio was searching for the Sorcerers stone and he almost went insane because he believed that time stopped on a Monday He wasnt able to communicate with his family in Spanish because he only spoke Latin He was tied up to a tree and before he died Ursula liberated him
Jose Arcadio III was a teacher but the Colonel wanted him to take care of the city He became a dictator and tyrant and he used his students as a personal army He fell in love with Pilar but did not know that she was his mother She wanted to push him away so she introduced him to Santa Sofia de la Piedad and she became his wife Soon they had a daughter and they named her Remedios the Beauty The news about the governments army getting closer spread across the town and Jose Arcadio III decided to fight He died and Macondo was taken over Soon after he died Santa Sofia de la Piedad gave birth to twin boys – Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo

Colonel Aureliano was trapped in a battle and the government decided to shot him in Macondo He was saved by his brother Jose Arcadio II who was soon after killed in a mysterious way Rebeca backed down from the social life and she lived like that until death

Colonels son – Aureliano Jose decided to join his father in the war He came back to Macondo because he loved his aunt Amaranta They started a sexual relationship that lasted until Amaranta became aware of what she was doing He then went back to the war and he almost got killed

During the 32 war confrontations Colonel Aureliano had 17 sons with 17 different wives It was a custom to send young women to spend the night with the warriors and then they would go to the Buendias house and baptize the children All of the sons had the fathers name but the mothers last name

The war kept raging on and it was pointless until the Colonel declared peace Macondo started to develop and aside from a chief it got phones electricity and a railway Foreigners came to the town and started a banana plantation The banana fever started and more and more people came to the city in search of a job on the plantation

On an anniversary of peace declaration in Macondo all of the Colonels sons showed up During a Church ceremony all of the 17 sons had a sign placed on their forehead and thanks to it the government tracked them down and killed all of them so that the family would just disappear
With years a new generation of Buendias grew up Soon the word about the beautiful Remediosa started to spread She remained innocent until the day she died and naïve like a child but her beauty caused deaths of a few men that were deeply in love with her

One day like a saint she rose to the sky Ursula spent her life believing that the twins switched places in childhood and they grew up under each others name Aureliano Segundo got married to Fernanda that grew up far away from Macondo She couldnt get used to living there

As years went by Ursula became older so Fernanda took care of the house Aureliano Segundo had a mistress Petra and he kept on living with her despite his marriage When he made love to his mistress their animals procreated at great speed and they became rich because of them They had three kids – Renata Remedios called Meme Jose Arcadio IV and Amaranta Ursula

Jose Arcadio Segundo joined a strike on the plantation The national army was called to put the strike under control The workers were surrounded and shot on the main square Their bodies were thrown in to the sea Jose Arcadio was the only survivor He testified about it but nobody believed him

The banana business fell apart and in the next five years Macondo struggled with nonstop rain Macondo became lethargic and forgotten

When the rains stopped Ursula died Fernanda decided to send her children to Europe to get a good education At the same time she would run away from the disaster spreading through the family Something was rotten in the family
Meme was Fernandas first child and during vacation she fell in love with Mauricio Babilonia but when Fernanda found out about them she set out for him to be killed She claimed him to be stealing chickens Meme kept from that moment one quiet until her death as a sign of protest Fernanda thought that it was best for Meme to be placed in a convent After seven months Fernanda was given Memes child and she named him Aureliano Babilonia but she never claimed him as the part of the family

Aureliano grew up locked in the house His only companion was Jose Arcadio Segundo

Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo were exhausted and they both died at the same time During the funeral their bodies were switched and each of them lays in the wrong grave

When Fernanda died Jose Arcadio IV came home from Rome He spent his days with Aureliano Babilonia but soon he was killed The last remaining man from the family was Aureliano Babilonia He lived alone in the house and he slept in old Malquiadess room and he wanted to reveal the truth of his parchments With time the parchments started to make sense and then Amaranta Ursula appeared She shook him out of his loneliness and the two of them started a love affair without knowing they were family
Macondo was getting worse and the town was falling apart Amaranta Ursula got pregnant and she died giving birth She gave birth to a son Aureliano that had a pigs tail He was eaten by ants

After that Aureliano Babilonia dedicated himself to the parchments He realized that Malquiades parchments contained his families prophecy The first one was tied to the tree and the last one was eaten by ants His faith was written down in the parchments and the faith of the family Before he finished translating the parchments a great storm occurred He realized he will not live to read the last verse In the last verse it was stated that the town will be destroyed by a storm and that it will be deleted from humans knowledge as soon as Aureliano finishes the last verse"
40,Kibritçi Kız,"Most terribly cold it was it snowed and was nearly quite dark and evening  the last evening of the year In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl bareheaded and with naked feet When she left home she had slippers on it is true but what was the good of that They were very large slippers which her mother had hitherto worn so large were they and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast

One slipper was nowhere to be found the other had been laid hold of by an urchin and off he ran with it he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet that were quite red and blue from cold She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron and she held a bundle of them in her hand Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day no one had given her a single farthing

She crept along trembling with cold and hunger  a very picture of sorrow the poor little thing

The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair which fell in beautiful curls around her neck but of that of course she never once now thought From all the windows the candles were gleaming and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose for you know it was New Years Eve yes of that she thought

In a corner formed by two houses of which one advanced more than the other she seated herself down and cowered together Her little feet she had drawn close up to her but she grew colder and colder and to go home she did not venture for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money from her father she would certainly get blows and at home it was cold too for above her she had only the roof through which the wind whistled even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags
Her little hands were almost numbed with cold Oh a match might afford her a world of comfort if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle draw it against the wall and warm her fingers by it She drew one out Rischt how it blazed how it burnt It was a warm bright flame like a candle as she held her hands over it it was a wonderful light It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top The fire burned with such blessed influence it warmed so delightfully The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too but  the small flame went out the stove vanished she had only the remains of the burntout match in her hand

She rubbed another against the wall it burned brightly and where the light fell on the wall there the wall became transparent like a veil so that she could see into the room On the table was spread a snowwhite tablecloth upon it was a splendid porcelain service and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums And what was still more capital to behold was the goose hopped down from the dish reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast till it came up to the poor little girl when  the match went out and nothing but the thick cold damp wall was left behind She lighted another match Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree it was still larger and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchants house

Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches and gailycolored pictures such as she had seen in the shopwindows looked down upon her The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when  the match went out The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher she saw them now as stars in heaven one fell down and formed a long trail of fire

Someone is just dead said the little girl for her old grandmother the only person who had loved her and who was now no more had told her that when a star falls a soul ascends to God

She drew another match against the wall it was again light and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother so bright and radiant so mild and with such an expression of love

Grandmother cried the little one Oh take me with you You go away when the match burns out you vanish like the warm stove like the delicious roast goose and like the magnificent Christmas tree And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noonday never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall She took the little maiden on her arm and both flew in brightness and in joy so high so very high and then above was neither cold nor hunger nor anxiety  they were with God

But in the corner at the cold hour of dawn sat the poor girl with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth leaning against the wall  frozen to death on the last evening of the old year Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches of which one bundle had been burnt She wanted to warm herself people said No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen no one even dreamed of the splendor in which with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year"

In the police station Alex demands a lawyer and is laughed and beaten again by the police PR Deltoid visits Alex and spits in his face before leaving The officers force Alex to make a statement confessing to his crimes Alex confesses everything he did for the past twentyfour hours and includes the betrayal by his friends The police put Alex in a holding cell where he has to fight off two prisoners trying to molest him

Alex eventually manages to get some sleep and dreams about Beethoven He imagines violent lyrics to Ode To Joy An officer wakes him the next day and tells him that the old woman that he assaulted has died overnight

After many court hearings and testimonies from PR Deltoid Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in a State jail
He is given an identifying number and told that while in jail he will only be known by this number
Over time we are told that the first two years of prison are a nightmare for Alex He is made to work every day making matchboxes in the workshop and constantly assaulted by fellow prisoners and guards He misses his days as a criminal and wishes he could get out When he hears that Georgie has been killed while robbing a house with Dim and Pete he is overjoyed

Alex gets a new job in the prison operating the stereo for the prison Chaplin He enjoys this and likes the Chaplin The Chaplin encourages him to read the Bible and Alex enjoy the violence and sex in the book He listens to classical music as he reads about Jesus suffering on the cross

Alex asks the Chaplin about a new program he has heard of which shortens prisoners sentences The Chaplin says that he doesnt approve of it but Alex presses to be recommended for it The program called Ludovicos Technique is experimental

After getting into a fight with another inmate Alex is sentenced to participate in the technique regardless It is called Reclamation Technique by the doctors The Chaplin seems to be upset as he apologizes to Alex for what is about to happen to him

Reclamation is another experimental technique that is supposed to remove the desire to hurt others After the treatment is over Alex will be released from jail Alex thinks the idea that the State will make him into a good boy is laughable

The next day Alex is brought to a hospitallike building where he meets a doctor named Branom Alex is given his own room and many amenities and told that all that he has to do for the procedure is watch a series of special films After every meal he is to be injected with something that Alex assumes is a supplement
However the next day he is taken to a room with a huge wall screen and strapped down to a chair The chair has special clips that are designed to keep his eyelids open at all times

Alex already physically weak from his first injection is forced to watch a film about an old man being beaten and stripped naked by two young men Afterward he watches a violent film about a young girl being gang raped Alex feels sick watching the films and finds that he is reacting differently to the violence than he normally does He wonders how the videos could have been made with the victims consent as they appear so real

Alex is made to watch more violent films as a doctor named Brodsky measures his reactions through wires that are connected to the chair Alex begins to get more and more sick watching the films and begs for the doctors to turn them off The doctors just laugh at him

After he is done for the day Alex is returned to his room where he is visited by Dr Branom Branom tells Alex that his brain is in the process of learning that violence is wrong and that he should expect to feel a bit sick for a few days
After he leaves Alex thinks about how he still plans to do evil things after being released from prison

A man referred to as a Discharge Officer visits Alex and talks with him a bit Before leaving he asks Alex if he would like to punch him to see how he is getting on with his treatment Alex does take a swing at the man but misses and afterward becomes violently ill just as he had when he was watching the movies
That night Alex dreams of more violence and wakes to vomit He finds that he cannot leave his room to do so and must wait till nausea has passed He lies on his bed shaking and afraid to go back to sleep

Alex resumes his treatment the next day and reacts with violent anger when one of the films plays Beethovens Fifth Symphony He calls out for the doctors to stop the film but the doctors only puzzle over his reaction to the music

The doctors tell Alex that he is undergoing a treatment which involves associative learning They are teaching his brain that violence is wrong by injecting him with something that makes him sick before viewing violent films Alex assures them that he has learned his lesson but the doctors merely laugh at this and pat him on the shoulder

Alex continues his treatment for many days His attempts to rebel are all met with failure One day Alex realizes that the wires and injections are no longer causing him nausea and headaches that he is receiving but the films alone are doing it

This realization brings him to tears Later that night Alex attempts to knock out an orderly to escape but when he raises his fist to strike the man he is overwhelmed with nausea and staggered by it The orderly punches him in the face

Alex realizes that he feels better receiving the punch than giving one On the last day of his treatment Alex is given back all of his old things including his razor He is brought to the screening room once again but this time in place of a screen a panel of welldressed men sits to judge him Dr Brodsky tells the men to observe Alex as a model citizen
An old man is brought in to taunt and pinches Alex and he longs to reach for his razor but immediately feels sick when he thinks about it Alex realizes that he must change the mans hostility He offers the man his razor but the man slaps it out of his hand

Desperate to escape the situation Alex begins licking the mans boots and clings to his ankles until the man falls over The doctors laugh at this but Alex is pained by the mans violent fall and helps him to his feet

Brodsky calls the man and the man leaves the room Brodsky tells the panel that any violent thoughts on Alexs part are accompanied by immediate physical distress and thus he is forced to show good behavior to avoid it

Alex is distressed by the argument that ensues between the panel members and asks aloud What about meAm I just to be a clockwork orange One of the panel members scolds Alex for talking and the argument resumes
Brodsky calls in the second volunteer and a beautiful girl enters Alex thinks about raping her right away but the sickness reasserts itself and he ends up bowing to her and professing a noble devotion After the girl leaves Alex feels stupid for playing into the doctors game

Brodsky tells the panel that Alex has become a True Christian who is ready to turn the other cheek Alex is made to undergo more humiliating demonstrations and press conferences before being released and put out on the street with nothing but the clothes on his back

He goes to a diner for breakfast and finds a picture of himself at one of the conferences in the paper The accompanying article talks about his treatment and what it means for the future of crime

Alex decides to head home and notices that the streets are cleaner than he remembers them When he gets to his parents house he finds a stranger eating dinner with them Alex learns that his parents have rented out his room to this man His mother begins to cry worrying that Alex has broken out of prison but he explains that he was released

However when Alex goes to his room he finds that all of his things are gone His father explains that the police took all of his possessions to compensate his victim In this case all of his things went to the old womans cats

Alex must keep smiling to keep from getting sick Joe the lodger begins to berate him and his father tells him that he cannot stay there Alex begins to cry and leaves his parents house
He goes to the record store he used to frequent and asks to hear Mozarts Fortieth Symphony but when the music starts he quickly remembers the damage that Ludovicos Technique did to his love of classical music and must run from the store

He goes to the Korova next and orders a hallucinogenic milk drink As he drinks and hallucinates he begins to think about killing himself Alex goes to the library to research painless suicide methods and while there is discovered by an old man named Jack whom he beat up several years earlier

Jack recognizes him and calls the other elderly library patrons to assault Alex Alex cannot defend himself even though the patrons are all feeble Alex quickly asks the librarian to call the police who arrive after Alex has been soundly beaten

When the officers arrive Alex is shocked to find that Billyboy and Dim are among them Dim and Billyboy have heard about Alexs treatment They assume that Alex provoked the library patrons and drive him out into the countryside to beat him brutally and leave him out in the wilderness
Alex avoids going back to town and instead follows the sound of a tractor to a farming village He knocks on the door of a cottage and begs for a glass of water from the man who answers The man living in the cottage is the writer whom Alex beat two years earlier He doesnt recognize Alex and offers him food and charity

The man is a political protestor who recognizes Alex from his newspaper article and wants to use Alex to dislodge the current government He confides in Alex that his wife died of shock after being raped two years earlier

Alex stays the night in the mans cottage and finds another copy of the manuscript A Clockwork Orange Leafing through the manuscript Alex discovers that it is about how the man thinks that people are fruit that grows on a tree that was planted by God

God needs the fruit to slake his thirst for love However some people are in danger of being turned into machines by the progress of the modern world Alex beings to doubt the mans who he learns are named F Alexander sanity

F Alexander is cheerful when he greets Alex that morning and tells him that he has been writing an article about him and talking on the phone to his associates Alex remembering the night he attacked F Alexanders house unthinkingly responds that he didnt think the man had a phone F Alexander tenses up at this but his suspicion passes quickly
When talking to F Alexander Alex momentarily slips into speaking with droog slang and this causes F Alexander to get suspicious again as he remembers the slang from when his home was broken into

F Alexanders associates Z Dolin Rubinstein and DB arrive and fawn over Alex Dolin wishes that Alex looked more tired and beaten down and this offends Alex who slips back into his slang again Alex grows increasingly offended by the men treating him like a means toward their political end

Alex set off on a rant during which he uses a large amount of droog slang and F Alexander suddenly seems to get a crazed gleam in his eyes

Dolin grabs Alexs arm and the men bring him to an apartment in the city Before they leave they ask Alex if he is responsible for F Alexanders wifes death Alex replies that he has paid for his sins and then begins to feel sick

Alex lies down and falls asleep When he awakes he hears classic music coming from another room and begins to feel sick again He tries to go outside but finds that he is locked into the room he is He bangs on the walls and begs them to turn off the music He stumbles around the room and begs for God to help him
On the floor Alex finds two pamphlets One of the pamphlets reads DEATH TO THE GOVERNMENT and the second reads Open the window to fresh air fresh ideas a new way of living He sees this as a sign to jump from the window Alex prays to God to forgive the world for ruining him and then jumps

The fall does not kill Alex as he intended but he does become severely wounded and is unable to get up off the ground He thinks that F Alexanders associates meant to kill him for their politics

Alex slips into unconsciousness and wakes up a week later in the hospital Alex is covered in bandages and missing several teeth He drifts in and out of consciousness as doctors tend to him One day he wakes up to see F Alexander and his associates telling him that he served Liberty well

They show him newspaper headlines castigating the governor among other officials and Alex tries to yell at them but cannot speak through his broken mouth

Alexs parents visit him and say that Joe has returned to his hometown after being beaten by police in the street They offer to let Alex come back home and apologize for turning him out Alex orders them away and says that if he comes back things will have to abide by his rules from now on

Once he is alone with his thoughts Alex realizes that he isnt experiencing nausea when he thinks violent thoughts anymore He asks the nurse if something has been done to his head and she answers vaguely Eventually a doctor informs him that he has been cured of his nausea by deep hypnopaedia
Some time later the Minister of the Interior visits Alex accompanied by photographers and reporters He apologizes to Alex and asserts that the government never meant him any harm He also says that Alex is now cured and they have set up a job for him when he is released from the hospital F Alexander has been imprisoned for Alexs protection The Minister tells Alex that he should think of him as a friend

Before leaving the Minister gifts Alex with a large stereo which he uses to listen to Beethovens Ninth Symphony
Alex is released from the hospital a short while later In the final chapter he sits with his new droogs Len Rick and Bully at the Korova

Alex and the others try to figure out what to do with their night and Alex begins to think that he has tired of the routine of theft and violence Alex feels the hallucinations kick in and punches another patron in the stomach before leading his droogs out into the street

The droogs come upon an old man and Alex tells Bully to beat him up They then go to the Duke of New York where they bump into the same women that Alex met there in the first chapter Alex turns them down this time Eventually though he agrees to buy them drinks and as he is getting his money clip out a newspaper clipping falls from his pocket

On the clipping is a picture of a baby The droogs get hold of it and make fun of Alex for being soft Alex rips the picture up and chastises the group much to their confusion He tells them they are evil for taking advantage of the helpless

Alex leaves the bar alone and feels off He relates that he doesnt enjoy listening to classical symphonies anymore but now only listens to operatic German love songs Alex bumps into Pete and learns that Pete has since married and put the life of a droog behind him

Now he and his wife Georgina are managing to scrape by on their pooled incomes Alex is amazed that Pete has grown up so much He leaves him and goes to a cafe where he sits to think about his life Alex now eighteen years old wonders what is in his future and thinks about all of the great composers who had already done so much by the time they were his age

Alex leaves the cafe and pictures himself married with a son of his own He likes the idea Alex feels that this is what he sees as being grown up and that youth is just a windup toy that constantly runs into obstacles Alex realizes that he is no longer young"
42,Silahlara Veda,"The book is told from a first person perspective narrated by a man called Lieutenant Fredric Henry Henry begins by describing the small Italian village in which he lives It is the late summer and troops from World War I often went by the house and down the road and that the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees He tells us that if a car goes by especially fast it was probably carrying the king as he makes trips out to assess the battlefront almost everyday
A friend of Henrys a lieutenant and surgeon named Rinaldi tells him of a beautiful girl named Catherine Barkley that he has fallen in love with Henry agrees to loan Rinaldi some money so that Catherine will think he is a wealthy man and his friend convinces him to come with him to meet the woman When he meets her Henry is struck by Catherines beauty and especially her long blonde hair They talk as Rinaldi is busy speaking to another nurse and Catherine confides in Henry that she recently lost a fiance on the battle front She asks him if he has ever loved and he says no On their way home Rinaldi jokes that Catherine seemed to prefer Henry to him

The next day Henry goes to see Catherine again He finds her in the garden and chats with her both of them agreeing to not talk about the war Eventually Henry attempts to kiss her and Catherine resists and slaps him Henry points out that this aside has gotten them to stop thinking about the war After this Catherine lets Henry kiss her and begins to cry saying Were going to have a strange life

Henry and Catherine begin to see each other regularly although Henry knows that he is not in love with her He feels that he is involved in a complicated game of seduction Hearing that he is going to be sent off to face a raid in the town of Pavla Henry tells Catherine that he is off for a show and that she neednt worry Catherine gives him a medal depicting St Anthony to protect him Pavla undergoes bombing while Henry is there and at one point he experiences a bright flash and heat like a furnace A trench mortar had exploded in the hall where he was eating dinner Henry is wounded and thinks himself near death

While Henry is recuperating in the hospital Rinaldi visits and tells him that he will be given a medal for his heroism in battle Insisting that he didnt do anything heroic Henry protests but Rinaldi wont take no for an answer Rinaldi also tells Henry that America has officially declared war on Germany and President Wilson is soon to follow with a declaration of war on Austria Soon Henry is transferred to a hospital in Milan to recover He is excited by the prospect of seeing Catherine who was recently send to the same hospital to work When he gets to the hospital Henry meets the ward superintendent Miss Van Campen and the two take an immediate dislike to each other After she denies him wine with his meals Henry goes around her and asks for a porter to bring him several bottles of wine and the evening paper

Over the summer Henry begins to recover enough to learn to start using crutches He and Catherine spend all of their nights together and begin to discuss marriage Catherine admits that she is unwilling to get married as she is sure that if she did she would be sent back home But she does pledge to be faithful to Henry

By September Henrys leg is nearly healed He receives three weeks of convalescent leave after which he will have to return to the battlefront
He discovers from a British major also staying in the hospital that the Allied forces have been greatly wounded The major suggest to Henry that the allies will surely be beaten in another year but that as long as no one notices all will be fine Catherine informs Henry that she is pregnant and worries that he feels that she has trapped him He comforts her by telling her that he loves her and is excited about having a child with her He tells her that they have to be brave and that the coward dies a thousand deaths the brave but one

The next morning Henry feels ill and is diagnosed with jaundice Miss Van Campen blames his alcoholism for the condition and accuses him of making himself sick on purpose to avoid being sent back to the battle front She files a report to deny him his convalescent leave Henry tells Catherine that he is to return to the war sooner than previously thought and she is understandably upset Before leaving they walk around the city together going out to eat and finally finding a nice hotel to spend the night together Catherine admits that even though it is a nice hotel and she buys an expensive nightgown to wear for the encounter she still feels like a prostitute Henry asks her how she will manage with the baby and she tells him that she will be fine and that she will have a nice home set up for him when he returns

Henry is sent back to the town he was injured in a place called Gorizia He quickly finds that the summer was a bad one for the war and he was lucky to get injured when he did to avoid death Henry is reunited with Rinaldi who asks him about Catherine and whether or not they have gotten married yet He also asks if Catherine is good in bed which offends Henry as he considers such talk disrespectful Apologizing Rinaldi suggest they drink a toast to Catherine and go out to have dinner
The next day Henry travels to a particularly hard hit region of the country called Bainsizza He meets with a man called Gino who tells him a tale about the terrifying guns that the Austrians have Gino tells Henry that there will be nowhere to go should the Austrian army decide to attack

Soon the men happen upon a German bicycle troop The troop is heavily armed and the men decide to start onto another road to avoid them As they start to head down an embankment they are shot at A bullet hits Aymo and kills him Henry and his men soon realize that it was the Italian rear guard themselves who accidentally shot and killed Aymo as they have been made jumpy by the presence of German troops in the area Henry and his men realize that they are in more danger from their own troops than they would be in facing the enemy They decide to hide until dark in an abandoned farmhouse Henry camps out in the hayloft while Piani and Bonello go out to search for food Soon Piani returns alone reports that Bonello left the farm in the hopes of being captured and taken prisoner so that he could escape certain death
Piani and Henry spend the day in the barn and set out at nightfall to rejoin their troop They eventually come across a gathering of soldiers where officers are being separated and questioned about the so called treachery that led to the Italian defeat Henry finds this insulting and insists that the men cannot interrogate officers this way Considering him belligerent two soldiers grab him and restrain him He watches as a lieutenant colonel is led away and shot to death for abandoning his troops As the men of the battle regiment are focused on the loss of life Henry uses the opportunity to slip out of their grasp and dive into a river behind them He begins to swim downstream hearing shots being fired over his head Henry lets himself be carried downstream for what seems to him to be a very long time Eventually he climbs out removes the stars that identify him as an officer from his shirt and jumps aboard a military train that evening In order to avoid being seen and possibly recognized on the train Henry hides under a canvas tarp in a car stocked with guns

45,Faust,"The play opens with a conversation between a director a clown and a poet The three begin to argue about what makes for a good play and present all of their points of view The directors idea of a good play is one that becomes a great commercial success the poet thinks it should be about artistic integrity and the clown only states that these two things need not be mutually exclusive That a play can be both a commercial success and true art The director ending the argument reminds them that there is still much work to be done if they intend to put on a play at all He then begins to speak to the audience informing them that they are about to see the whole universe presented in the play starting with heaven and making their way through hell

In the beginning of the first act we are presented with a meeting of God and three archangels Gabriel Michael and Raphael are reciting praises to God when the devil enters The devil says that he cannot imitate their praises because he has seen that mankind is made sad by having the reason and intelligence that God has given them God tells the devil about Faust a man whose judgment is not clouded by the reason he posses and whom he believes will always ultimately see the truth The devil disagrees about Faust and he and God eventually make a bet about the man For all of Fausts life God says that the devil may attempt to seduce and influence him but if he cannot he will have to admit that there are still good men in the world After the wager is sealed we are taken down to earth Specifically to the study of the man named Faust

Faust sits as his desk frustrated He is middle aged and has mastered many schools of thought over his life but still finds himself unsatisfied He feels that he is held back by the limits of basic human knowledge and moreover that he has not reaped enough earthly rewards for his trouble The next day Faust is watching the local townspeople celebrate Easter when he notices a small black dog following him as he walks He finds that it makes him uncomfortable and that he worries is might have something occult about it

The next day Faust is in his study when a nobleman enters The nobleman is the devil in disguise He attempts to tempt Faust by offering him unlimited wealth and earthly pleasures but Faust refuses on the grounds that he does not think this will satisfy his longing The devil persists taunting Faust and driving him to rebuke his Christian values He asks Faust to start a new life with his help He tells him that if he agrees to sell his soul to him he will grant all of Fausts desires and make him more than mortal Finally Faust accepts though he doubts the strange noblemans ability to fulfill his promises The devil makes him promise that if any moment of his life hereafter is so perfect rare and beautiful that he calls out to make it last forever that will be the last moment of Fausts life and he will then die and serve the devil forever

The devil begins to take Faust on a journey starting with a tavern where he tries to show Faust that pleasure can be derived from good company and cheer But Faust thinking him wrong asks to leave The devil then brings Faust to the kitchen of a mysterious witch The devil tells him that the witch will make a potion to remove thirty years from Fausts age so that he will be young again Faust agrees and drinks the potion and has a vision of a beautiful young maiden in a mirror on the witches wall The devil promises him the maiden and later Faust meets her Gretchen the beautiful woman however refuses his advances Faust demands that the devil get Gretchen for him but the devil tells him that he has no power over her because of her innocence and purity Faust decides that he will seduce her without his help and tells the devil to get him jewelry and fine gifts to give to her

Later that night Faust asks the devil to see Gretchens bedroom When he is taken there he finds her room and the simple furnishing heartwarming He tells the devil to leave and then talks to the audience about how at home and at peace he feels in Gretchens room The devil returns with a chest full of beautiful jewels and they decide to leave them for Gretchen After they leave Gretchen comes back in and discovers the jewels She is so entranced by their beauty that she doesnt even wonder where they came from

Back in Fausts study the devil informs him that Gretchens mother has found the jewels and suspicious of their origins has turned them over to the church The next day we are taken to the house of a friend of Gretchen named Martha Gretchen tells Martha that she has found another chest of jewels but that she wont be telling her mother about them this time Martha advises her to keep the jewels a secret The devil enters the house pretending to be a traveler who knew Marthas husband year before and saw his death Martha who never had proof that her husband was dead asks him if he can provide such proof so that she can remarry The devil tells her that he will bring a young man named Faust who can personally attest to the death He asks that Gretchen also be present because his friend has an eye for beautiful women Gretchen is embarrassed but agrees Faust objects to the devils plan saying that they cannot come up with a credible lie about a man that they have never met However the devil argues that Faust as a scholar speaks on subjects he knows nothing about all the time Faust reluctantly agrees

Back in the garden Faust courts Gretchen while the devil courts Martha Faust finds Gretchen charming and innocent A few days later the couple finally kiss The devil interrupts them to say that he and Faust need to leave Gretchen tells Faust that she cannot introduce him to her parents because her mother will disapprove but she pledges her love to him and swears to meet him again soon Faust finds himself in love with Gretchen but torn between his innocent love for her and his sexual desires He also broods that he is becoming too dependent on the devil for the help he is providing The devil attempts to convince him to stop brooding and reminds him that he has everything hes ever wanted He tells him he ought to go ahead and make love to Gretchen since that is his main purpose in being with her anyway Faust protests but the devils continued erotic descriptions of Gretchen stir his passion and he rushes off to meet her
When we are shown a scene between Faust and Gretchen again they speak about religion Gretchen asks him if he believes in God Faust answers that he doesnt but he tolerates the belief in others and argues that he believes that God is in nature A short while later Gretchen and a woman named Lisbeth are gossiping about a local girl who has become pregnant and fallen from the towns good graces as a result Gretchen expresses her sympathy for the girl and tells the audience that she herself has become pregnant by Faust and that he has now abandoned her Soon Gretchens secret gets out and her brother a soldier opens the next scene standing in the street talking about how Gretchens good reputation was once a source of pride for their family but now he knows her purity has been lost He is waiting at her door hoping to catch her lover going in and gain revenge

Faust and the devil walk up the dark street to Gretchens window where the devil sings a mocking song to her Faust himself appears to have no feeling left for the girl and is interested only in satisfying his carnal desires again Gretchens brother Valentine comes forward and challenges Faust to a duel The devil assists Faust in the duel and the two get away leaving Valentine dying in the street Hearing the noise Gretchen comes out and finds her brother dying She tries in vain to comfort him only to have him insult her and predict a tough life for her with his dying breath

Heartbroken and desolate Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion that kills the woman Later she is visited by an evil spirit that taunts her for her misdeeds Gretchen is so overcome by the spirit that she faints while attending her brothers funeral

A year passes and Faust has completely forgotten about Gretchen He attends Walpurgis night a superstitious German festival said to contain the dancing and orgies of many spirits and witches with the devil While entangled in a dance with a young witch Faust has another vision of Gretchen but this time it is of her in chains and distraught He becomes so upset that he wonders away from the party only to be led back by the devil
Later Faust realizes that Gretchen is in prison and asks the devil to free her The devil refuses saying that there is no reason and that she deserves to be there Angered by this Faust insults the devil and the devil reminds him of his part in Gretchens downfall saying that humans always think they want to make a deal with him without truly considering the consequences Faust continues to insist that the devil helps Gretchen and finally the fallen angel relents agreeing to do what he can

Faust and the devil make their way to Gretchens prison cell When they find her it becomes clear that she has been driven insane by her imprisonment Gretchen does not remember Faust and fears him thinking that he is a hangman who has come to execute her for drowning her baby Learning of what happened to his child Faust despairs crying out into the night This makes Gretchen remember him and she leaps up her chains falling away The two embrace and Gretchen is happy that he has returned and thinks that everything will be well now However Gretchen refuses to escape the cell She tells Faust that she can see no peace except that of her grave The devil reminds Faust that they dont have long and must leave immediately if they dont want to be caught The devil tells Faust that Gretchen is condemned but a voice from heaven interrupts only to say Redeemed The devil summons Faust and they leave together while Gretchen calls out for them

After this part two begins with the devil pretending to be a jester in the court of an Emperor Officials are reporting to the Emperor that the country is having monetary issues The devil suggests that they mind for gold beneath the land Though the court officials distrust him they agree that he seems to be telling the truth The Emperor ends the meeting by announcing that there is to be a carnival for Ash Wednesday Soon we find that the Emperor has accepted the devils idea of mining for gold and the country has been flooded with the new currency

At the carnival the Emperor asks Faust to invoke the spirits of Helen of Troy and Paris Faust agrees asking the devil to help The devil tells him he will need to visit the Eternal Mothers strange spirits who live deep within the earth Faust agrees and we are shown him making Helen and Paris appear in a Greek Temple Most of the courtiers are skeptical Faust finds himself overwhelmed by Helens beauty and tries to get to her only to be knocked down by a burst of thunder The devil carries the unconscious Faust out of the room seeking help to wake him up in the form of Wagner the scholar who has replaced Faust at the university Wagner creates a tiny version of a humanoid man telling him to go to Fausts side and spy on his dreams The little man does so telling the devil that Faust cannot be woken right now but that they should take him to Greece to participate in Walpurgis night

In Fausts mind he hallucinates a dream sequence in which he is once again reunited with Helen of Troy and fights a way as a mighty commander When he awakes he finds that the Emperor has been overthrown and is holed up with his army attempting to take it back Faust finds the Emperor and offers his assistance which is gladly accepted The devil helps too and the Emperor eventually wins the battle and is put back on his throne After ward Emperor rewards Faust by giving him a strip of coastal land But Faust quickly finds that much of the land is underwater and therefore worthless

Now more than a hundred years old Faust fails to acquire more land and broods over his losses He asks an elderly couple to sell him their house so that he may have more land and when they refuse he asks the devil to take it from them The devil kills them and takes the cottage and Faust not expecting them to die is distraught
Faust beings to have more visions this time seeing four grey hags who tell him of his coming death He says that he cannot die until he is free from the devils power and that he has learned that men should not want for things that are beyond what mortal power The devil commands a gang of monkeys to being digging a grave for Faust and Faust overhearing the work assumes that this is the culmination of his plan to get more land He finally utters the words that the devil said would end his bargain overcome with happiness and wanting the moment to last forever

Faust drops dead immediately afterward The devil assumes that he has won Fausts soul but soon angels come to take it away Angered he blames his own mishandling of the bet and the strange ways that love and happiness manifest themselves in humans"

One night the three Musketeers are out partying and on their way home meet Richelieu He asks them to escort him to the lodging where they had been drinking where he is meeting with Milady who had been escorted by Rochefort The three musketeers waiting below overhear the conversation Richelieu wants to send Milady to England to meet Buckingham and inform him that if he continues with the war against France the Cardinal has sufficient information to disgrace the Queen forever If the plan fails Milady agrees to assassinate Buckinghams and asks for absolute endorsement of her actions signed by Richelieu She also asks the Cardinal to help avenge her to find where the Queen has hidden Constance and to imprison DArtagnan and execute him Athos quickly leaves the lodging pretending to ride ahead as an advance guard on the way back to camp but turn around and enters the lodging after the Cardinal had leave He confronts Milady and threatened to shoot her if she does not hand over the letter she received from Richelieu then warns her that if she tries to hurt DArtagnan he will kill her

When the three musketeers return to DArtagnan the four want to discuss secretly but find no safe and quiet place to do so They make a bet with another group of soldiers that they can hold off the enemy for at least an hour When they get to the stronghold they find dead soldiers takeoff their ammunitions and settle down to eat They easily turn aside two attacks by the enemy meanwhile informing DArtagnan of Miladys conversation with Richelieu and resulting meeting with Athos After weighing various options they decide to send two of their servant Bazin and Planchet to warn Lord Winter and the Queen of the assassination plots trap by Milady and the Cardinal They then calmly return to camp being hail and to the cheers of thousands French troops DArtagnan was promoted to corps musketeers as a reward for his bravery by Richelieu despite his frustration with the four friends DArtagnan finance the servant journey by selling the diamond he received from the Queen and the two servants safely complete their missions

In England Milady is trying everything possible to get out of captivity Every day she works on the feelings of the young officer who is her prison guard convincing him that she herself is a Puritan being persecuted for her faith by the Buckingham who stole her virginity after drugging her then put a mark on her so no one would believe her story and Lord Winter wickedness Lieutenant Felton believes her story and she convinces him to release her and kill Buckingham Lord Winter sends Felton away but he returns that night and open the window bars of Miladys prison allowing her to escape He then murder Buckingham after being capture he sees her ship far off on sea and realizes that all was a lie The King becomes tired with the war at La Rochelle he requests that musketeers should escort him back to Paris the four friends are with the escort After escorting the King safely back to Paris they immediately set for Bethune to rescue Constance knowing that Milady is on her way there to kill her

On the way DArtagnan again spots Rochefort but is unable to pursue him In few days Milady arrives at the convent in Bethune Judging that the Mother Superior is not in support of the Cardinals she buy her over by lying that she is being persecuted by Richelieu so the Mother Superior then introduces her to a fellow victim whom she realizes is Constance She easily convinces Constance that she is a friend of DArtagnan and Constance discloses to her the news that DArtagnan is arriving that day Soon a man arrive at the convert on a horse this man happen to be the Comte de Rochefort After receiving news from Milady he goes to deliver it to the Cardinal and Milady prepares so that Rocheforts valet will transport her from the convent to Armentieres She persuaded Constance to go with her but before they could leave they hear the sound of the musketeers horses Milady prepares to escape through the convent garden but Constance is reluctant to go with her She poisons her and then escapes through the back door When DArtagnan and his friends arrive Constance condition is beyond help she died thereafter

Soon Lord Winter arrives the four friends and Lord Winter depart the convent in search of Milady They find a note stating that Milady departed for Armentieres which was drop by Rochefort valet Athos said he is ready to undertake task alone because she is his wife Four valets were sent to Armentieres by Athos instructing them to take different route in order to know Miladys whereabouts while he visits a strange man in a red cloak The following day the five men and the strange man in red set for Armentieres together They meet Milady in a secluded house where they tried her and all her crime are being narrated The man in red is the slayer of Lille his brother happen to be a young priest which was seduced by Milady to steal from a church and was mark for his theft but flee with Milady to de La Fères estate where he pose as her brother After Milady marriage to Athos he return to find his brother in imprison in his stead He turned himself in then commits suicide The slayer caught Milady and marked her the same way he was forced to mark his own brother Base on all the incriminating evidence they sentence Milady to death After being forgiven by her accusers she was taken to the shore of river Lys in Switzerland by the slayer where she was beheaded and her remains was dropped into the river

On returning to the war front in La Rochelle Rochefort arrests DArtagnan and took him to the Cardinal He was accused of treason by Richelieu without the idea of Miladys death DArtagnan informs him of the incident then produces the note Athos had taken from Milady proving that his deeds had been done by the authority of the Cardinal Richelieu who had by then develop admiration for the young Gascon drops the charges and honour him with a blank lieutenants commission in the musketeers DArtagnan offers it to all his friends but they all reject it on different basis Athos because he did not intend advance Porthos because he intends to marry his recently widowed lover and Aramis because he want to leave the musketeers to become a priest DArtagnan accepts the commission and serves for many years with honour During which he fights Rochefort three times and he was victorious in all they later become friends After a yearlong war La Rochelle falls"
49,Sapiens,"Three important revolutions shaped the course of history the Cognitive Revolution kickstarted history about 70000 years ago The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12000 years ago The Scientific Revolution which got under way only 500 years ago may well end history and start something completely different This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms

The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were insignificant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas fireflies or jellyfish

Just 6 million years ago a single female ape had two daughters One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees the other is our own grandmother

Over the generations the people of Flores became dwarves This unique species known by scientists as Homo floresiensis reached a maximum height of only 35 feet and weighed no more than fiftyfive pounds They were nevertheless able to produce stone tools and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants – though to be fair the elephants were a dwarf species as well

Today there are many species of foxes bears and pigs The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man It’s our current exclusivity not that multispecies past that is peculiar – and perhaps incriminating

Mammals weighing 130 pounds have an average brain size of 12 cubic inches The earliest men and women 25 million years ago had brains of about 36 cubic inches Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 73–85 cubic inches Neanderthal brains were even bigger

In Homo sapiens the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest

Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways Firstly they spent more time in search of food Secondly their muscles atrophied

An upright gait required narrower hips constricting the birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were getting bigger and bigger Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females Women who gave birth earlier when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively small and supple fared better and lived to have more children Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births And indeed compared to other animals humans are born prematurely when many of their vital systems are still underdeveloped A colt can trot shortly after birth a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old Human babies are helpless dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance protection and education

One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow Some researchers believe this was our original niche

humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust

Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers it’s hard to have both By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens

When Homo sapiens landed in Arabia most of Eurasia was already settled by other humans What happened to them There are two conflicting theories The ‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction sex and mingling As the African immigrants spread around the world they bred with other human populations and people today are the outcome of this interbreeding

The opposing view called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different story – one of incompatibility revulsion and perhaps even genocide

Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark In modern times a small difference in skin colour dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards an entirely different human species It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals the result was the first and most significant ethniccleansing campaign in history

The Tree of Knowledge
The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating between 70000 and 30000 years ago constitutes the Cognitive Revolution

But the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans not about lions and bison Our language evolved as a way of gossiping According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction

As far as we know only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen touched or smelled

But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things but to do so collectively

Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers

Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers That’s why Sapiens rule the world whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories

Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals Most people can neither intimately know nor gossip effectively about more than 150 human beings

Any largescale human cooperation – whether a modern state a medieval church an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination

Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins States are rooted in common national myths Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws justice human rights – and the money paid out in fees

There are no gods in the universe no nations no money no human rights no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings

Unlike lying an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in and as long as this communal belief persists the imagined reality exerts force in the world

No one was lying when in 2011 the UN demanded that the Libyan government respect the human rights of its citizens even though the UN Libya and human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations

The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals families and groups This glue has made us the masters of creation"
50,Zamanımızın Bir Kahramanı,"The writer was traveling through Caucasus mountains when he met Maximovich They became friends and told each other different life stories and he mentioned his friend the unusual Pechorin They served in the army together and lived in a fortress for a year He told the writer that Pechorin fancied a girl named Bela the daughter of a hated prince But also a robber was in love with her

51,İtiraflar,"“Confessions” tell a story of a religious life and concerns humans prayer and thanksgiving The work begins by Augustines calling for God who is supposed to help him in his writing about his own life

The foundation of the confessions is his past life about which he preaches while adding some opinions about the possibility of a sinless life

The work is divided into 13 books

The first book Augustine dedicated to the first 15 years of his life From the first book we can see his dedication to some classic authors such as Virgil

The book is written as a confession Augustine talks about his sins even the little unimportant ones He also felt the need to apologize for preferring playing over studying

He gave a harsh judgment of the ancient literature because he considered it to be madeup and a bad influence on youth

In the second book he describes his life from the age of 16 We found out about his passions sins and a bit outrageous life He also talks about his studying in Thagaste

The third book is dedicated to his studying in Carthage We see life through his student eyes his adventures love relationships and his big love for theatre

He was studying Cicerone at that time and he joined the Manicheans but he criticized it in the book
The end of the third book talks about his mothers dream She dreamed of her son turning to Christianity

His life from when he was 20 to when he was 29 is covered in the fourth book He got involved with rhetoric and still didnt give much thought to converting

In the fifth sixth and seventh book he described his life in Rome and Milan He studied and listened to bishop Ambrosius came closer to Christianity and decided to leave the Manichaeism

The studying of Apostle Pauls work that concerned the Christs secrets influenced him a lot
The eight book carried a special significance for Augustine Right in the middle of the book we can read everything about his conversion to Christianity One of the most important parts is when he was handed a book and told to take it and read it by a voice

In the ninth book he described the happiness he felt after the conversion He also wrote about his mothers death and his trip to Africa

The tenth book describes his present life the state of his soul in the moment of the writing It analyses the human life and arrogance sensibility and curiosity

The mentioned book came to life ten years after his conversion in 397 in Hippo

In the eleventh tenth and the thirteenth Augustine stops writing about the past and gets involved with the theme of eternity

The last book finishes in the same tone as the first one Augustine calls God to thank him for his mercy and kindness
In all of the books we can find the main characteristics we see in the autobiographies written after this one

They are Augustines childhood without the notion of faith sins he made in his youth reading of paganism works the downfall of his spirit reminiscence of his former life notion of time passing by and the problem concerning every religious man

Augustine also speaks about the symbolic things that had happened during his birth and about the influence of poverty on his life and his relation with his mother and her kindness

Augustine reveals the motives that made him write his work and we find out that his friends take most of the credit for his writing Still he emphasized that the most important motives were inside of him He wanted to serve as a role model and wanted to describe the ways he came to know faith

He started his storytelling ten days after his conversion “Confessions” is a retrospective work because he talk in the first person singular and occasionally mostly in the last few books he writes about the present

Most of the event are told from his present point of view

The base of the storytelling is his souls calling for salvation His narration is also marked with theology and philosophy He talks to God thanks him and prays in his monologues In the end it all looks like a dialogue between a sinner and God

He described his life because he wanted to make it an example for others in the future He believed that his life was Gods decision and that God is the only one that can allow him to know life at its fullest

His intellectual growth also had a big influence on his life He described completely opposite intellectual studies that divided his life into two phases Ancient writers led him to sin while the Bible helped him know true faith"
52,Ağla Sevgili Yurdum,"Our story opens on a beautiful morning in South Africa There is the lovely village of Carisbrooke just seven miles up the road from Ixpo The grass is a wave of green lushness the stream tinkles past the birds sing and the trees dance to their music But that is not the village our story is based in Ndotsheni is that village Here the grass has been destroyed by overgrazing cattle and fire The water is gone When rain does come its in the form of storms and the red dirt of the land runs like blood The crops are feeble and dry In Ndotsheni only the old and women alone with children live They scrape out a meager living When the children grow to adulthood they leave

Among the young people who have left is Reverend Stephen Kumalos son Absalom Its been a long time since the Reverend heard from his son so his hopes raise some when a letter arrives He sees the letter is from Johannesburg but so much of his family lives there now It could be his brother John or his sister Gertrude She is twentyfive years younger than him She left for Johannesburg to find her husband who had left her and their new baby A few years ago his son Absalom left to find his aunt and Stephen hasnt heard from either of them

Stephen is reluctant to open the letter He knows that once he reads it it will change his future It can never be unread When his wife comes in she also at first hopes and fears it is from or about their son So she opens it quickly The letter is from a priest in Sophiatown Johannesburg Theophilus Msimangu He is writing about Johns sister Gertrude She is very ill and he requests that Stephen comes right away When his wife asks him what he plans to do Kumalo says he will use the money they had saved for their sons education to make the trip While he is holding the money in his hand he studies it hoping to see some answer in it When she sees him his wife says he should go ahead and use it Absalom will never use it for school once a young person goes to Johannesburg they never return

Stephen begins to rage his son leaves his brother his sister No word from any of them Not one letter Do they not understand how worried he is His wife begs him to relax hes hurting himself He realizes his anger is hurting his wife so he relents They gather all the money they have saved for other things He doesnt know how much he will need so he should take all they have As she watches him leave to pray at the church then she puts her head down on the table with the patient suffering of black women with the suffering of oxen with the suffering of any that are mute Stephen leaves for the city the next day The mist comes in while he is waiting for the train Some people see the mist as ominous and others see it as promising it depends on why they are leaving But Stephen doesnt see it at all He is too worried about his sister and whether he will see his son While he is waiting for a friend is with him Before Stephen can board the train the friend asks him to check on his friends daughter She too went to away and he hasnt heard from her She is in the small town of Springs by Johannesburg Stephen tells his friend that though he will be busy he will try to take the time out to go to Springs and check up on the girl Then Stephen sits down to worry But when he pulls out his Bible and begins to read he finds comfort

By the time the train reaches Johannesburg they have traveled a full day and night They have gone through mining towns with huge conveyors that bring the ore up from the ground where the black men work When they disembark from the train Stephen is overwhelmed by the vast amounts of people and the traffic He carefully winds his way through the crowds but only makes it as far as the traffic light He doesnt understand how they work and is unable to move A young man comes up to him asks him where he is headed Stephen tells him Sophiatown so the young man takes him to the bus station He has Stephen wait in line while he takes Stephens money for a bus ticket Stephen is leery but wants to show trust so he gives him a pound of his meager savings

After a while Stephen realizes the young man stole from him Stephen meets another man who is also going to the mission at Sophiatown They ride the bus together The man takes him straight to Mr Msimangu at the mission The news is not good Stephen learns of all the violence happening in Johannesburg The whites are afraid of the blacks and the blacks are being attacked too When he asks about his sister he finds out she has become a prostitute The Msimangu tells him that she has her son with her but it is not a place for a boy When Stephen inquiries about his brother John he is told that John is a local politician and has left his church He knows nothing of Absalom but will ask around They talk about the broken tribes of the white men Although neither of them hates the white men since they brought God to them They are saddened by the way they have broken the tribal structure Msimangu takes Stephen to the lodgings he had arranged for him His room is with a local church lady Mrs Lithebe For the first time Stephen uses a flush toilet and is amazed When he goes to bed Stephen is amazed that such a short time ago he was with his wife

The next morning Msimangu takes Stephen to find his sister Gertrude The neighborhood she lives in is disgusting The gangs fight and the children run wild in the streets because the schools dont have room for them When he finds her the change from happy girl to a sullen alcoholic prostitute is obvious She never found her husband When he asks to see her son she doesnt know where he is Stephen tells her she has shamed the family Stephen asks Gertrude if she has seen Absalom she says he spends time with their brother Johns son He wants her to come back with him He will get a room for her at the place he is staying and they will return home Stephen feels that he has accomplished some of what he set out to do and his tribe is slowly getting back together

The next morning Stephen is writing a letter to his wife while he listens to his sister sing a song while she helps Mrs Lithebe with the housework He is happy today he will start to look for Absalom Mismangu comes to take Stephen to see his brother John When they arrive Stephen asks Mismangu to come in with him At first John doesnt recognize Stephen But soon they are talking over tea John asks Stephen to talk in English John tells him that his wife left him ten years ago and now he has a mistress living with him John complains that in Ndotsheni he had no status He had to follow the orders of the tribal chief who John thought was an idiot Here in the city he is a man of some importance John also believes the church was too constraining John begins to orate As he speaks his voice grows louder and more bombastic He has the speech of a politician making promises for a black mans freedom He speaks of the black mans toil building the towers for the white men
Stephen sits listening to the words but hearing the lies He asks John what happened to his wife Why did she leave Did she value fidelity more than you did When Stephen has too much of the malignant speech he asks John to switch back from English to Zulu Johns mistress silently serves them tea and Stephen steers the conversation from Johns beliefs even though he does agree somewhat to his own business Stephen tells John that he has found Gertrude and now wants to find Absalom who is supposed to be with Johns son At first John cant remember where his own son is then he recalls they bother work for the textile plant in Alexandra As they are going to the factory Msimangu tells Stephen that a lot of what his brother said about the plight of the black man in Africa is true But there is only one thing that has power and that is love When a man loves he seeks no power and therefore he has power Msimangu continues by saying he can see only one hope for South Africa and that is white nor black men desiring money and power but in desiring only the good for the country coming together to work for it

At the factory Stephen and Msimangu learn that Absalom hasnt worked there for 12 months They are told that when he left he was living with a woman and her husband Mrs Ndlela in Sophiatown Upon arriving Mrs Ndlela Stephen discovers his son left there to go to Alexandra When Msimangu notices her looking sadly at Stephen he asks her why She tells him that she thinks he will find his son has fallen in with some bad company

The two priests start to catch a bus to Alexandra but are stopped by Dubula one of the three most important black leader in Johannesburg John being another one He tells them the blacks are boycotting the buses because of higher fares and talks them into walking the eleven miles to Alexandra Along the way a white man gave them a ride He went out of his way to give them a ride as far as the turn off for Alexandra As the men are walking the rest of the way Msimangu tells Stephen of all the crime in Alexandra Although it is one of the few towns black men can own property the crime is so rampant that a petition was put out to demolish it But the white men who were friends of the black men fought against it as much as the black men did They said there was more to Alexandra than the bad that it was important for a man to have a place of his ownWhen they arrived at Mrs Mkizes house where Absalom and his cousin had been staying she said they had left about a year ago When they asked her where the boys went from there she didnt know

When they arrived at Mrs Mkizes house where Absalom and his cousin had been staying she said they had left about a year ago When they asked her where the boys went from there she didnt know When asked how the boys acted she began to tremble and said they were fine Msimangu asked Stephen to go ahead down the road to find something cold to drink and he questioned her further She was still afraid but when he swore on the Bible he would not repeat anything she said to the police she began to talk She says that the boys often came home with what looked like stolen merchandise They were friends with a taxi driver called Hlabeni
The two priests call Hlabeni for a ride and begin to question him about the boys At first the man was afraid but after they assured him they were not policemen he tells them the boys went to Orlando and live in Shanty Town it is where squatters live As they ride down the road in the taxi they notice a lot of people walking and white drivers offering them rides When a white driver is stopped by the police he tells him to take him to court The white man is doing nothing wrong offering to give people rides so they can boycott an unfair practice is not against the law Msimangu is amazed that some of the white men would risk prosecution to aid the black men and their rites

Because of war in Europe and North Africa the money to build more housing is tied up therefore the housing in Johannesburg and the surrounding towns is scarce But everyone comes to Johannesburg Thats where the jobs are and the taxes are paid All roads lead to Johannesburg Where to live once they get there is the problem The houses are full to bursting Dubula tells them to set up tents near the railroad tracks Overnight a Shanty town is built The newspaper takes pictures state jumps into action to build houses for the homeless This is a workable plan to get the government to step in but soon more people pour into the city and think to repeat it But this time the government reacts with anger They push the people backIn Shanty

In Shanty Town the priests ask a nurse about Absalom She sends them to Mrs Hlatshwayo with whom Absalom was staying She tells them Absalom was sent to the reformatory At the reformatory they learn Absalom was a model inmate and was released early for good behavior and because of his youth and so he could take care of his pregnant girlfriend The man at the reformatory tells Stephen that Absalom was saving money to marry her
When Msimangu and Stephen find the girl she is tiny and sad She says Absalom left a few days before and she doesnt know if she will ever see him again Msimangu is angry and wants to leave Stephen says that he doesnt want to leave his grandchildThe newspaper reports the murder of a noted white man who was going out against crime in the cities and the cruel treatment of blacks Arthur Jarvis Stephen remembers the man as a boy His fathers land was near Stephens village After this the book leaves the story of Stephens hunt for Absalom to tell of the life in South African under apartheid

The newspaper reports the murder of a noted white man who was going out against crime in the cities and the cruel treatment of blacks Arthur Jarvis Stephen remembers the man as a boy His fathers land was near Stephens village After this the book leaves the story of Stephens hunt for Absalom to tell of the life in South African under apartheid Stephen and Msimangu renew their search for Absalom They retrace their steps and discover the police are also looking for him When Absaloms pregnant girlfriend comes to find out what she should do if the police come back Stephen tells her to be honest with them If his son gets into contact with her to call the police and then to call him Stephen gives her the number where he is staying and pays for the taxi to take her home out of his last few dollars

Stephen and Msimangu learn that Absalom has been arrested for shooting Arthur Jarvis and his cousin was an accomplice Stephen tells John his son is in prison When the brothers go to see their sons Stephen finally lays eyes on his son Absalom is ashamed and admits to shooting Jarvis because he was afraid and he still wants to marry his girlfriend
As the men are leaving the prison they meet with John He is determined to get a lawyer He wants to prove his son was not there when the man was shot Stephen tells him the story Absalom told him they two other boys helped him break in but he is the one who fired the gun out of fear John tells his brother that he will save his own son but Stephens is a lost cause Stephen is advised to get a lawyer of his own so Johns lawyer cannot hurt Absaloms case The head priest at the church finds a lawyer who will take the case pro deo for God so Stephen wont have to pay for the lawyer Stephen goes to tell Absaloms girlfriend what was going on She is lost and confused At first Stephen is furious at her promiscuity but he finally asks her to come home to Ndotsheni after she marries his son He then takes her back to Mrs Lithebes house to wait for the trial and so he can care for her and her unborn child"
53,Frankenstein,"Frankenstein begins with a quote from Paradise Lost Did I request thee Maker from my clay to mould me Man did I solicit thee from darkness to promote me

Then there is an introduction from the author that is widely suspected was actually written by her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley the poet The introduction goes on to say that the story came about because of a contest between her husband Lord Byron and some friends on a rainy afternoon while vacationing in Switzerland Lord Byron suggested they all write ghost stories but Marys story is the only one that was completed She had had some trouble coming up with an idea when she had a nightmare about a scientist who had made a man that came to life When she woke up terrified the words flowed onto the page

Frankenstein is written in an epistolary form The letters are from Robert Walton a frustrated writer who is now the captain of a ship headed to the North Pole to his sister Margaret Saville in England Walton wants to find a northern passage through to the Pacific Ocean to research the magnetic source of the Earth and if all else fails he hopes to at least step foot on some undiscovered place

Walton is feeling lonely because none of his men are very good at conversation and he has no gentlemen on board Then one day while caught between massive sheets of ice Walton and the crew spot a huge man like creature on a sledge about a half a mile away The next morning while still stuck in the ice they find a man who is almost dead He was also on a sledge but there was only one dog still alive The crew hauls him in but only after Walton assures him they are heading north does he consent to be saved As the new arrival regains his health the two men become friends Slowly the man begins to tell Walton his story

54,Momo,"A semicircular theatre was placed between ruins in a town and it was thought to be the remains of an amphitheatre from the past A girl named Momo lived there The citizens had built her a sleeping space and brought her groceries every day

They didnt want to tell the police about her so she wouldnt finish in foster care On one occasion she said she ran away from a place like that and that she had no desire of going back there They suggested her to move in with one of them but in the end they decided it would be best for Momo to stay in the theatre so everyone could spend some time with her

With time the theatre became an itplace where everyone came to spend some time with the unusual girl Momo knew how to listen to others and after talking to her people would have a clear look at their situations Even the people who were a bit uneducated would have bright ideas after talking to her She was the middleman for people who were arguing

Momo met a lot of friend and the closest to her were Gigi and Beppo Gigi was a fun person that liked to invent stories and make people happy with them When he would spend time with Momo he would tell her the stories about a princess Momo and prince Gigi Beppo cleaned the streets and he did his job with pride and dignity

The theatre was visited by many children who would come there and invent new games Everything changed when The Men in Grey came to town in grey suits hats and cigarettes in their mouth They were the agents from the Timesaving Bank and they would tell people how much time theyve spent doing nothing and that the time has come for them to join their bank
Their work wasnt under any kind of observation and the weird thing was that no one remembered talking to them but they all followed their instructions and with time more and more people joined their bank

People who worked and didnt have time to do anything else were just piling up A cold atmosphere ruled the town and people fought more with each day Fewer children visited the theatre because their parents told them that only hobos gathered there

They went to different kindergartens where they were thought the skills that will be useful in the future The parents worked more so they would have more money to buy toys that would have no effect on the childrens imagination Momo became lonely

She managed to convince some of her friends that joined the bank to visit her and because of that one Man in Grey visited her He tried to talk her into giving up on her friends
He tried to convince her that she will damage her friends because the only important thing in life is to acquire more that the others and that friendship and love will come with time As a replacement for her friends he offered her a doll Babygirl

Despite the fear that the grey people would leave behind them Momo wasnt afraid or able to be bought by a doll so she decided to investigate the emptiness the man had left behind him

One of the agents accidentally spilled the truth and she found out that the time people had saved in the bank was forever lost She told it to Beppo and Gigi and then to the other children They decided to organize a protest by carrying banners that called everyone to give up their savings and come to a gathering where theyll finally know the truth

The same day Beppo fell asleep on the junkyard and accidentally became a witness in the trial of the agent BLW553c that said the truth in front of Momo He was sentenced to death and when they took away his cigarette he disappeared They also decided to deal with Momo

Beppo rushed to the theatre to warn his friend He came before the Man in Grey but Momo wasnt there Before Beppo came to the theatre a turtle carrying a sign Follow me appeared

Momo found it weird that a turtle spoke to her but she followed her When the agents showed up in the theatre and didnt find the girl they started a manhunt all over the city The turtle was wiser and navigated Momo so carefully that the agents couldnt follow her
The whole time while they were walking messages appeared on the back of the turtle and she communicated with Momo In the end she took her to a part of the city where a street named Never and the house named Nowhere were

It was the house of Master Hora the master of time The turtle was his accomplice and could predict the future half an hour ahead Because of her gift she was able to bring Momo to safe

The master Hora ruled the time and divided it evenly so everyone would have enough The thieves tried to reach him to steal it all away but they could never locate him

Hora was a nice man that explained Momo that the Men in Grey want to harm her He took her to a lake from which flowers emerged all the time He explained that every flower is a clock and that the lake was actually her heart It was actually a representation of what any human heart looks like because time represented life and life are placed inside the heart

Hora placed her to sleep for a year and a half so that the words she needed to help her friends would appear inside of her She didnt see anyone in the city and the Men in Grey managed to isolate her from everyone

Gigi worked as a storyteller and had a lot of money and another friend of hers opened a fast food restaurant so he had no time to spend with his family A contractor spend more time building houses out of cheap lowquality material just to make more money

Beppo was convinced by others that Momo was held captive and that he has to save time in order to save her The other kids ended up in special repositories in which they were being prepared to be like their parents one day The Men in Grey held the city in their hands but Momo was still a threat so they kept her isolated from all of her friends

The inconsolable Momo decided to go to Master Hora again but this time she was followed by a group of agents They kept their distance so they wouldnt be exposed Hora explained to Momo that the Men in Gray took pedals from the flowers dried them folded them and then used them in their cigarettes That was their source of life

More and more grey smoke appeared around Horas house and it built up a wall around it Hora was able to send time to others only if the sky was clear but when it was filled with some there was a big possibility that the people will receive intoxicated time and become like the Men in Grey

Because of that Hora decided to stop the time to give Momo a chance to discover where the agents were keeping the time they had stolen When the time stopped the agents rushed to Horas house but when they realized the time has stopped they went to their shelter and started looking for cigarettes
Despite everything being frozen Momo managed to move around because Hora gave her a flowerclock She decided to follow the Men in Grey Only six of them remained and when they saw Momo they were desperately trying to get her flower They disappeared one at a time a Momo had help from the turtle

When the last agent disappeared Momo managed to free the time With the help of a flower whirlpool she managed to escape the underground labyrinth She went back to the theatre where he friends waited for her They were all happy like they used to be

Summary

Robinson Crusoe was born in 1632 in York as the third son He didnt have a vocation so he started to dream of adventures His father gained a great fortune and his family belonged to the middle class
Robinson Crusoe had 2 brothers One brother died and the other one disappeared Crusoe lived in England and since he didnt know how to do anything his father asked him to work as a salesman and so inherit half of his lifework Crusoe wanted to be a sailor His parents tried to talk him out of it but didnt succeed

His childhood went by and he was always looking at ships He always wanted to go far away so he accepted to be a salesman and a sailor He went on his first sail It was so terrifying that he changed his mind and decided to ask his father for forgiveness When the storm settled and the journey became pleasant he forgot about that decision

He was thirsty for money and fame so he went to Guinea to make a sale It went successful so he moved towards Africa but the ship was attacked by the pirates He spent more than two years in captivity and after that he managed to runaway on a boat with a boy After thirty days they were saved by a ship that was going to Brazil

Captain was kind and helped Robinson When they came to Brazil he suggested Robinson to visit his friend who had a sugar plantation Robinson bought some land and started a sugar cane plantation After four years he went back to the sea After 12 days of peaceful sailing the ship encountered a storm From all of the sailors only Robinson saved himself

He ended up on a deserted island and didnt know where he was but for him the only important thing was that he is still alive He started looking for a shelter and found a cave where he made a calendar so that he would know what year and day it is

He started making his own clothes and everything else that went to waste with time He tried to make a boat several times and save himself but he never succeeded After a few attempts to run away he got caught in a storm and barely made it out alive Unfortunately the ship that was nearby didnt have that luck and everyone died The only survivor was a dog who Crusoe named Jack

Crusoe learned a lot of new things for example how to hunt He made some chairs and a table started a diary learned how to make different tools It all kept him from going insane

In the next 4 years he managed to plant some rice and wheat After he took care of food and shelter he went on exploring the island He found out that there are turtles on the island He never gave up his wish to escape the island so he built another boat It was to heavy so he build a canoe to help him sail around the island When the wind almost carried him to the open sea he gave up on his escape from the island

He was taking a walk when he heard some noise and saw a man who was defending himself from the cannibals Crusoe saved him and considering the fact that it was Friday he named him Friday A few months after a ship was attacked by the pirates on the island Crusoe liberated the ship and the captain who later turned out to be Fridays father
After that Robinson went back to England When he managed to find his father he found out that his mother was dead Friday who was used to winter and snow had a tough time adjusting to the weather and Crusoe helped him In the end they decided to live together"
56,Savaş Sanatı,"In the fifth century about the same time as the life of Confucius a man named Sun Wu was born In the way of Chinese names Wu was his given name Sun his family name and then later he was given the title Tzu He came from a family of experts on the weapons for war At that time a family or clan owned information Knowledge passed down through generations father to son Sun Tzu would have taken the knowledge from his clan and expanded on it with Taoism and his own observations

Sun Tzu was an adviser to the king of the state of Wu Ho Lu eventually becoming his general Using psychology deceit strategy and diplomacy Sun Tzu developed his treaties of war

The book begins with the laying of plans for war Sun Tzu stresses that a well thought out and welllaid plan for war can mean the difference between life and death The five main factors to always be taken into account are moral law heaven earth the commander and method and discipline The moral law means that no matter how crazy the order may seem a good soldier will follow orders trusting in his leader implicitly His morality as a soldier of courage would keep him from becoming dismayed He would face dangers with complete faith and strength Fearless

Heaven means to always keep in mind the weather and the time of day When is the best time of day for maneuvers How will rain and cold affect the conflict What about the heat of the day Will the soldiers drop from heat exhaustion How will the weather effect weapons As in World War I the users of mustard gas learned quickly the dangers of shifting winds

Earth means to take into account distances danger and safety whether a pass is narrow or if the battle is to be fought on open ground Sun Tzu stresses this could easily mean the difference between life and death How far will your troops need to travel before engaging in combat Will they have time to rest or will they have to engage in conflict with weariness as a weakness before they even lift a weapon Are there overpasses that can possess a trap Where can the enemy hide Where could the ambush come from Are there trees to provide cover for the enemy As the settlers found out when trying to tame the American frontier there can be dangers hiding behind the trees in the forest When the battle is to be fought on an open field where will you find cover How will you be able to fight from a safe distance What kind of weapons will you need to employ The idea battle is fought with fewer casualties on your own side of the conflict Losing men that are used as shields or “cannon fodder” as they became known during the American Civil War is not acceptable in a sense of manpower count and is also detrimental to the morale of the troops They quickly lose faith in their commanders

The commander should be the epitome of wisdom and courage His orders should be completely trusted He should be strict yet fair Benevolent and sincere As a leader he should inspire respect His troops follow him without question It is a heavy mantle he wears and he must not falter This is why a good commander listens to his counselors taking into account their advice whenever he is making a decision on a battle Throughout history there are many instances of commanders losing their focus during battle They can become cruel forgetting the enemy is also human as did General Sherman when he marched across Georgia burning homes along the way Most of the people he left homeless were women and children How could his men respect his decisions when they were ordered to commit acts of cruelty

When Sun Tzu counseled on the importance of method and discipline he stressed the importance of organization in an army Separating them into workable troops The Romans used groups of ten Each group of ten had a leader ten groups of ten had another leader and ten groups of ten groups had another leader In todays armies this is delineated with different ranks such as in the United States Air Force Airmen Airmen First Class Sargent and its various degrees up to Chief Master Sargent Then the officers take over as their leaders starting with the lieutenant and going up to Generals and its increasing stars In the United States there have been very few men to reach the highest military rank of fivestar general they would include General Dwight D Eisenhower who parlayed his rank into the presidency for the United States in 1953
Another sign of the Romans learning these same lessons is the many roads that were laid throughout Europe as they made plans for conquering The saying all roads lead to Rome is because of this The Romans laid their roads with thoughts of the width of a chariot ridden by their commanders and then the laying of railroads followed this same plan Roman armies were engineers when not in battle Hadrians Wall was built in the United Kingdom during this time as a deterrent from the Picts and it still stands That is what good planning can provide lasting strength

Knowing the human brain has better retention when information is given in groups and lists Sun Tzus book is in groups and lists In his first chapter Laying Plans Sun Tzu says that he can forecast the victory of a defeat of a battle by considering just seven points 1 Which of the two kings has the full support of their troops the Moral Law 2 Which general is the most capable 3 Which side has the best advantage with the weather and terrain Heaven and Earth 4 Which side has the most discipline and enforces it consistently 5 Which army is the largest and strongest Throughout history this hasnt always determined the victor but more times than not it has 6 Which side of the conflict has better training for their soldiers and officers And last but not least 7 Which side has the greatest constancy of reward and punishment

Using all the points made by Sun Tzu are important in warfare as is the art of deception Sun Tzu pushes the importance of deception in war Appear to have a smaller army appear to be unprepared Lure the enemy into a false sense of victory then attack with discipline and greater power Hit him when he is unprepared after determining through the use of spies this is so Washington crossed the Delaware River to take the Hessian forces hired by the British on a cold Christmas night in 1776 His victory was complete with only the loss of 4 soldiers The Hessians were completely unprepared due to Christmas festivities and underestimating the American army

In the second chapter of his book Sun Tzu points out the financial costs of war especially if it lasts for a long length of time As the American Civil War One of the main reasons for the loss by the Confederate Army was the costs They didnt plan ahead for the war lasting very long The war completely bankrupted the Confederate states So many of the battles being fought on Confederate soil was also cost restraining Sun Tzu asserts a victorious army brings very little provisions and feeds off the enemy The Union Army took livestock used supplies and crops then destroyed the rest Throughout history this has proven effective for invading forces but didnt help the British forces during the American Revolutionary War Therefore Sun Tzu continues to point out that wars should be fought quickly But his most important point is that a leader must always keep in the front of his mind that the lives of all his people and the peace of his nation are in his hands He must handle with extreme care
Attack by stratagem is Sun Tzus advice in his third chapter Unfortunately this seems to be the chapter most overlooked in warfare He begins by urging the invading army to leave the city intact as much as possible Germany Iraq Egypt The amount of irreplaceable art that has been destroyed in war is beyond counting As is the amount of genius spilled in blood on the battlefields

Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting p15

He also advises avoiding a siege The amount of time needed to prepare and then to find a way to take the walled city would not be cost effective Sun Tzu gives an arithmetical formula that will raise the chances for victory in battle if your forces are ten to the enemys one to surround him if five to one to attack him if twice as numerous to divide our army in two If equally matched we can offer battle if slightly inferior in numbers we can avoid the enemy if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him

There are five essential facts to ensure victory 1 Know when to fight and when not to fight 2 Know how to handle both superior and inferior forces 3 Have the same animation of spirit throughout all the ranks 4 Be prepared and take the enemy when they are unprepared 5 “He will win who has a military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign

If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles

In the chapter Tactical Dispositions the information is important for war A lot of the advice is very zen A good fighter puts their mind beyond the possibility of defeat and then just waits for the opportunity of defeating the enemy An enemy provides the occasion of their own defeat Wait for them to make a mistake and be ready to take advantage of it To doubt victory is to admit defeat to lift an autumn hare is no sign of great strength to see sun and the moon are no sign of sharp sight to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear
Sun Tzu gives another calculation for an army in this chapter the military method First measurement Second estimation of quantity Third calculation Fourth Balance chances Fifth victory Measurement owes its existence to Earth estimation of quantity to measurement calculation to the estimation of quantity balancing of chances to calculation and victory to the balancing of chances All very zen

It is just as easy to control a large force of soldiers as it is to control a small force of soldiers A welltrained squad knows how to follow orders A well trained military force knows the chain of command In other words a soldier knows who to report to and would never dream of going over the head of their direct commander If he has a question or a problem that is the person he sees then his commander will take it on up the ranks if necessary By those same rights the orders come down from the top and will be followed to the letter

Throughout history every army has devised signals and signs to give battle instructions The Scots had their bagpipes the British had their drums The infantry had their trumpets the forces in the World Wars had their radios In battle there are not more than two methods of attack  the direct and the indirect yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers This method of confusion will keep the enemy from guessing your next move A good commander does not want to be predictable He wants to be quick and decisive leaving no room for anticipation from the enemy

A quick trip to victory is to discover your enemys weakness and his strong points Whichever army is the first to arrive has a better chance at winning They are rested the arriving army will not be The first can prepare the second will need time to prepare A clever commander never lets the enemy call the shots He is in control of the battle Keep the enemy agitated If he is resting harass him if he has plenty of food take it starve him out If he is in a good camp force him to move A common tactic in battle is to use spontaneous firing of weapons The enemy never knows when to expect an attack and therefore cant find rest This is the kind of tactic that took the Alamo in 1836

If you want to draw an enemy from his garrison attack a place he will be forced to defend After choosing a place for meeting the enemy dont let it be known The enemy must not be given the time to prepare If you are preparing to be attacked you have put yourself in a place of weakness A good commander chooses the time and place Find out the enemys plans and the likelihood of their success Military tactics are like water it shapes its own course Follows the path of least resistance Water keeps no constant shape and therefore adapts itself to changes As in warfare there are no constant conditions A good commander will go with the flow He must modify his tactics

A good commander takes care of his soldiers Makes sure they are fed well have a warm place to sleep and keeps their spirits up They have to feel their cause is just Everyone wants to be the hero not the villain The time of day a battle is called is also important when planning strategies a soldiers spirit is keenest in the morning by noonday it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp

Do not advance uphill towards and enemy nor go against him when he is headed downhill Both moves would put you at a disadvantage Do not make an enemy desperate Leave an opening so some of them can leave Do not interfere with an army returning home

Sun Tzu has more advice on war 1 when in a difficult country dont make camp 2 In a country where high roads intersect join hands with your ally 3 Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions 4 if you are hemmedin use strategy 5 If in a desperate situation fight

He also lists the five most dangerous faults of a general 1 Recklessness which leads to destruction 2 cowardice which leads to capture 3 a hasty temper which can provoke insults 4 a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame 5 oversolicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble

More important tidbits of advice 1 Camp in high places facing the sun 2 After crossing a river get far away from it 3 In order to keep your forces healthy choose dry ground 4 the rising of birds in their flight is a sign of an ambush as is sudden movements of animals especially small ones Watch nature for signs of the enemy 5 when some men advance and some retreat it is a lure 6 When you see soldiers leaning on their weapons they are starving 7 when a group sent to fetch water drinks first the troops are suffering from thirst 8 When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food and when the men do not hang their cookingpots the campfires showing they will not return to their tents you may know that they are determined to fight to the deathThe use of spies is an important part of
The use of spies is an important part of the victory in war There are five kinds of spies 1Local spies inhabitants of the district 2 Inward spies officials of the enemy 3 converted spies turning a spy of the enemy 4 Doomed spies giving false information to a spy of yours that has been turned to the enemy and 5 Surviving spies those who bring information back from the enemys camp after escaping Spies are an important element of war An armys ability to act is often based on their informationCharacter Analysis Author biography"
57,Uyanış,"Grand Isle is a summer retreat for the wealthiest French Creoles of New Orleans This is where Leonce Pontellier is spending his summer with his wife and children In the beginning of the novel he sits reading a newspaper on the front porch of the main guesthouse of the island The guest houses manager Madame Lebrun has two pet birds who make a lot of noise that disturbs Leonce and causes him to go back into the cottage that he has rented Down by the water his two young sons play under the watchful eye of their nanny Leonce sees his wife Edna coming back from the water with Madame Lebruns son a handsome young man named Robert Leonce scolds his wife for getting sunburned and invited Robert to play some billiards Robert declines the offer and stays to talk to Enda as Robert walks away
Edna and Robert talk for a long time Robert tells her about his plans to travel to Mexico at the end of the summer to seek his fortune She tells him about her childhood in Kentucky and her sisters upcoming wedding Later that evening when Leonce returns from playing billiards he is in good spirits He tries to talk to Edna about the gossip he heard in the club and is angered when she appears to not be listening Leonce checks on their children and tells her that one of them Raoul feels a little warm She tells him that the boy is fine but Leonce insists that Edna tends to him and harangues her for what he feels is her habitual neglect of the children Edna visits the childrens room in a perfunctory way and refuses to speak to her husband as she goes to bed After Leonce falls asleep Edna goes outside to sit on the porch and watch the sea as she weeps quietly She is beginning to realize that she is unhappy with her life Before this she has always felt comforted by her love of her husband but this evening she felt oppressed by him She mentions that it fills her whole being

The next morning Leonce gives Edna some money before he has to leave for a weeklong business trip While in New Orleans he sends Edna a box of BonBons as a gift and all of the other women in the resort swoon over Leonce and admits that he is the best husband they have ever seen Edna pressured admits that he is the best that she knows of Leonce cannot explain to himself why he feels that Edna is inattentive to their sons He merely feels that she does not idolize her children the way the motherwomen of the resort do and she does not worship him either Edna has a friend named Adele Ratignolle who Leonce sees as a star example of a motherwoman Leonce has had conversations with Adele about sewing chocolate and childbirth—the latter being much to his wifes horror Edna is not a Creole woman but being married to a Cerole man has immersed her in their customs However she is still not fully comfortable with their candidness

Back at the resort the reader now gets an insight into Roberts thoughts He has been working at the resort since he was a child and each summer he chooses one woman to whom he devotes all of his attention and time as an attendant One summer Robert picked Adele for this and the two joke about it now as they recall how he stuck to her Adele jokes that she worried her husband would be jealous of Robert It is implied that there was never anything to be jealous about However everyone on the island notices that Robert attentions to Edna this summer are slightly different than his usual attentions to women He is more playful and also deeper in his conversations Robert leans his head on Ednas arm while they are talking until she gently pushes him away Robert decides to go for a swim and though Edna initially declines she eventually agrees to join him

Once they begin swimming Edna forgets why she declined the offer in the first place She did want to go with Robert to the beach and while she is swimming she feels that a strange light grows within her that shows the way to her dreams She slowly begins to think of herself as an individual with agency in the real world and not just a wife or a mother Since Edna was a child she rarely discusses her inner thoughts and feelings with the world She has always felt that she had two sides one that conformed to the standards of society and another that wanted to rebel and question

Ednas developing friendship with Adele and experience being surrounded by candid Creole women gradually begins to make her come out of her shell and act less reserved Edna realizes that Adele may be the closest female relationship she has ever had Her mother died when she was young and her two sisters were very cold and distant The biggest relationships in her life have always been her absorbing unrequited crushes on men Before marrying Leonce she had a string of infatuations But Leonce was the first man to every really show any interest in her and she was pleased by this  and all the more pleased by the rebellion of marrying a Catholic However Ednas main object in marriage was to tie herself down and end her unrealistic fantasies giving herself an anchor to adhere to societies standards This created an odd sense of satisfaction in her marriages lack of passion

On the subject of Ednas relationship with her children she finds that she is uneven on her feelings and impulsive with her affection She feels that she has blindly assumed the role of motherhood and that she is always relieved when her children are sent away to visit family She expresses some of these sentiments to Adele and shocks herself with her honesty However after hearing this confession Adele begins to worry that her friend is going to take Roberts romantic attentions more seriously than the other women normally do and warns him to leave her alone Robert is insulted by this and tells Adele that he hopes Edna does take him seriously because he is serious Adele reminds him that having a real affair with a married woman will ruin his reputation as a gentleman

A few weeks later Madame Lebrun throws a small party for the renters on the island Robert asks an older woman Mademoiselle Reisz to play the piano for Edna Edna enjoys piano music as listening to it often gives her visions of different emotions She often sees a naked man staring out at a departing bird in hopeless resignation and children playing with a dancing woman But now as she listens to Reisz play she does not just see images of emotions she feels them intensely By the end of the playing she is in tears Reisz pats her shoulder and tells her that she is the only audience a player needs

But everyone has enjoyed the performance and buoyed by this cheer Robert suggests that they all go for a nighttime swim As the group walks down to the beach Edna wonders why Robert isnt spending as much time with her as he used to She notices that he isnt around as often but that when he is he seems sweeter and more devoted than ever

Edna is reluctant to get into the water because despite many attempts at learning she is still not a strong swimmer All at once she begins to feel empowered and swims out into the water She decides that she wants to swim out a bit from the crowd and feels an odd sense of control over her actions and her body She swims out too far however and begins to worry that she wont be able to make it back to the shore When she does she decides to go back to her rental for the night although her husband and the others entreat her to stay
Robert runs after Edna to walk her home and she wonders if he thought she was afraid to walk back alone He tells her that he didnt think that but cant explain why he followed her Edna tries to talk about the new emotions and feelings that she has had lately and Robert tries to tell her that he understands but neither expresses themselves well and they end up sitting in silence on the porch until her husband returns

When Leonce returns he tells Edna to go to bed but she resists and says she will stay outside a while longer She realizes that she has always submitted to her husbands requests without thought and now that she isnt her assertiveness is irritating to him Edna wonders how she could have spent their marriage yielding to his demands as she did and feels stronger for not doing it In defiance of her attitude Leonce joins her on the porch and smokes cigars all night until just before sunrise At that point Ednas tiredness defeats her and she tells her husband that she is going inside to bed She asks if he is coming too and he tells her he wants to finish his cigar first

Over the next few days Edna and Robert grow close again while she begins to grow more distant from her husband At dinner one evening Edna is informed that Robert is leaving for Mexico Edna is shocked and hurt by this news as Robert did not tell her this although she spent the last few days with him Edna leaves during dinner and returns to her rental alone Robert appears at her door a little while later to tell her goodbye She tells him she is disappointed and offended by him not telling her that he was leaving Robert seems to be holding back from explaining the reason for his departure to her fearing that he will reveal his true feelings Edna asks Robert to write to her while he is away and he agrees before quickly leaving Once alone Edna realizes that her infatuation with Robert may have just been another unrequited crush

Edna becomes sullen and misses Robert intensely after he leaves She doesnt bother trying to hide her level of sadness over his departure from anyone even her husband When she discovers that Leonce saw Robert briefly in New Orleans while on a business trip she interrogates him about the other man
Just before the summer ends Mademoiselle Reisz speaks to Edna about Robert and tells her that Roberts mother Madame Lebrun is more partial to her other son a man named Victor than she is to Robert As a result of this the two brothers have a history of not getting along This upsets Edna although Reisz does not realize it

After the summer is over Edna Leonce and their children return to their lavishly decorated home in New Orleans Edna continues to act differently when she arrives home She stops observing her weekly reception day a day when she would normally stay nicely dressed and wait around the house to receive visitors Instead of doing this she goes into town without giving the servants an excuse to give any visitors that might arrive This angers Leonce as he fears that her snubbing any women in town might anger their husbands with whom he does business He leaves the house to have dinner out instead of with her Distraught Edna feels as though she has to destroy something When she is unable to crush her wedding right under her foot she breaks a glass vase instead

Edna visits Adele in town and realizes that she now pities her friend for her blind contentment with her life as a housewife Edna decides that she wants to take drawing lessons and soon begins spending most of her time painting much to her husbands chagrin One day Edna goes to visit Mademoiselle Reisz at her home in town but discovers that the woman has moved In order to find her new address she then visits Madame Lebrun and her son Victor answers the door Victor speaks to Edna for a while and she finds him entertaining and funny However Edna is saddened to hear that Robert has written his mother two times from Mexico since he has still not written her at all Lebrun gives her Reiszs new address and Edna leaves to track the woman down After she is gone Lebrun comments on how different Edna seems

Soon Edna visits Reisz again This time the woman is pleased to tell her that she has received a letter from Robert and that he talks of Edna throughout it Edna begs to read the letter but Reisz denies this request However Reisz does agree to play a piano piece for her and Edna weeps as she listens to her play Chopin

Leonce takes his concern for Ednas mental state to the familys doctor He tells her that he and his wife are no longer sleeping together and that she seems to be having some notions about womens rights The doctor asks Leonce if Edna is associating with any contemporary womens clubs and when he confirms that she isnt the doctor begins asking about Ednas family Leonce admits that Edna comes from a mentally sound respectable family but that her younger sister Janet is a bit of a vixen Janet is soon to be married however The doctor asks if Edna can attend the wedding and Leonce say that she has already confirmed that she does not intend to as she considers weddings to be lamentable spectacles The doctor finally tells Leonce that this is most likely a passing whim that will run its course with Edna However the doctor privately wonders if Edna may have another man in her life He promises to have dinner at Leonce and Ednas home so that he can privately investigate Edna for himself

In the next section we meet Ednas father a former army colonel Ednas relationship with her father is similar to the relationship she has with her husband  she waits on him hand and foot and placidly agrees with everything he says The Colonel and Edna have a disagreement about attending her sisters wedding and Leonce stays out of it Leonce decides to attend the wedding alone so that Janet will not feel insulted by her sisters absence This causes the Colonel to attack Leonce for what he believes to be a mishandling of his wife He says that a man must use coercion and authority over their wife to get her to bend to their will
Soon Ednas father leaves The doctor comes by for dinner with the family but observes nothing odd about Ednas behavior Leonce travels to New York for Janets wedding and the children leave to go spend time with their grandmother Edna has the house all to herself for the first time in a while and finds herself enjoying it One day Edna goes to the races and meets with a man named Alcee Arobin whom she had met previously while at the races with her father Alcee and Edna got along nicely although he is a bit of a free spirit and sometimes makes her uncomfortable with his candidness He and Edna have a dinner together where his bold topics of conversation make her nervous However she is not worried about being unfaithful to her husband but only to Robert Days later Alcee writes Edna a letter of apology for the way he acted at dinner and she forgives him

Edna visits Mademoiselle Reisz and reads a new letter from Robert She doesnt tell Robert that Edna is reading his letters because she knows that he is trying to forget about her Later that night Alcee visits Edna and the two being talking After a while they kiss and Edna feels that it is the best kiss that she has ever had However after Alcee leaves Edna cries over the guilt she feels for betraying her husband and Robert She regrets kissing Alcee and realizes that she doesnt love him

Edna soon decides that she intends to move into a smaller house around the corner from her husbands house She writes to him to tell him of this but begins moving before he replies to her Alcee visits while Edna is packing up everything that Leonce didnt buy for her Edna is focused on her work and does not pay much attention to Alcee

Edna throws a dinner party for her friends in celebration of her new house and sparkles in a new dress as the hostess Alcee stays late after everyone has left the party and the two kiss again Leonce finally discovers that Edna has moved and writes back telling her that he disapproves Leonce only worries that people will think that the reason for the move was financial difficulties He arranges to have the big house shut down for renovations as a cover story Edna visits her children at their grandmothers house and enjoys their company for the first real time Adele soon comes to visit Edna in her new house and warns her that she needs to worry about her reputation Adele says that people in the town are gossiping about Edna and Alcee

Edna goes to see Reisz for the womans advice but she is not home so Edna decides to wait in her apartment till she returns There is a knock on the door and Edna is shocked to see Robert on the other side He has been back in town for two days Edna demands to know why he didnt come to see her and Robert embarrassed tries to explain She doesnt feel that she sees the same look in his eyes that she saw before when she believed him to be in love with her She asks him why he never wrote to her and he says that he didnt think she would be interested

Robert walks Edna home and she invites him for dinner He hesitates to say yes but relents when Edna looks hurt Inside the house Robert tells her of his travels in Mexico and says that he thought only of her She confirms that she only thought of him as well After dinner as Edna and Robert are in the parlor talking Alcee drops by Alcee seems to like Robert and speaks with him conversationally but Robert is only cold in return Robert soon announces that he has to leave and Edna sends Alcee away as well so that she can be alone

One day Edna bumps into Robert in town He seems uneasy and embarrassed by agrees to have lunch with her She tells him that she is disappointed that he never contacted her and that she isnt afraid to tell him this although he may think its unwomanly He accuses her of being cruel and Edna changes the subject back to something light to avoid confrontation The two go back to Ednas house after dark and end up kissing Robert confesses that he only went to Mexico to avoid his love for her but he only thought of her while he was there He wonders if she could be his wife and if Leonce would set her free Edna announces that she isnt one of Leonces possessions and she can give herself to whomever she wants Robert is shocked and perhaps even uneasy with this declaration Just then a servant interrupts to tell Edna that Adele is in labor and wants to see her Edna tells Robert that she loves only him and to wait for her to return before she leaves

During Adeles delivery it becomes obvious that Edna is still traumatized from the births of her own two children She begins to have disturbing flashbacks to her own labor and leaves as quickly as she can once the baby is born The doctor who spoke with Leonce is also Adeles doctor and he walks Edna back to her house after the birth asking her if she plans to go on another vacation with her husband Edna announces that she doesnt and she does not intend to be forced into anything anymore She says that no one can oblige her to do anything anymore except for her children This worries the doctor and he tells her before parting that if she ever wants to come see him for help he would be there for her Edna is confused by this as she does not feel that she needs help When she gets back home Edna finds that Robert has left and he wrote her a short note that says he loves her but he cannot stay

Edna stretches out on her sofa and lies awake deep in thought all night The next day Edna returns to the island early to have some respite to think Victor is surprised to see her She makes plans to have lunch with him soon and then walks down to the water ignoring his claim that it is too cold for swimming The night before she thought of Robert and how he would eventually disappear from her thoughts She thought of her husband and her indifference toward him and she thought of her children and how they were the only thing truly binding her to this earth Once shes on the beach Edna removes her swimsuit and stands naked in the open air for the first time in her life She swims out without looking back and realizes that Robert never understood her She wonders if the doctor would have but realizes that it is too late now She swims until exhaustion overtakes her and then she surrenders to the sea"
58,Balıkçı ve Karısı,"Once upon a time a fisherman lived in a small wooden house placed on a beautiful sand beach He didnt live alone He had a wife who he loved immensely He loved the waves the deep blue see and he adored fishing He would sing on the way and talk to animals
His wife was almost never in a good mood She didnt like their house and she wanted a big house where she would have servants and a closet filled with beautiful dresses Every day she would reproach him about not making enough money to fulfill her needs

He would stay out fishing until tiredness would kick in While he was fishing the wife did some gardening but they didnt grow much vegetables due to the climate

The fisherman went to the sea as every other day and he would see the sun rise That beautiful picture filled him with joy and he was happy that its not going to rain like it did the other day He thought he could catch much more fish that the previous days

He was persistent in his desire to catch something but every time he threw the bait the crabs would eat them He didnt know what to do because he couldnt come back home empty handed to his wife because she would be furious

While he was thinking about that he caught a fish It was huge and he barely got it out of the sea When he placed her into his boat she started to talk She asked to be returned to the sea and that she will grant him 3 wishes if she grants her one The fisherman let her go but didnt ask for anything

He went home and told his wife about everything that had happened She was furious about him letting go of the fish without making any demands He didnt quite understand his wife and she asked him didnt he think it was strange for the fish to talk He still stared at her and she ordered him to go back tomorrow and get the fish back to grant him three wishes

He went fishing so he wouldnt have to listen to his wifes reproaches but he didnt hope to see the fish again because his wife wanted nothing else but a big house with expensive furniture a garden and a henhouse

The fisherman called for the fish and she actually dived out of the sea and asked him what he wanted He told her about his situation with his wife and she asked him what his wifes wishes were The shy fisherman told her that she wanted a big house with expensive furniture a garden and a henhouse

The fish granted his wishes because of his kindness and then she disappeared again The fisherman went to the house and he saw the magnificent house his wife wanted The inside and the inside of the house were luxuriously decorated and the closet was filled with beautiful dresses The fishermans wife sat in her chair and watched the chandelier
The fisherman was happy because his wife got her wish and he felt fine living in a bigger house instead of a small cottage

After a few days his wife started complaining again She told him that the garden was too small and that it wasnt shined enough so the crops will go to waste and also she didnt want to clean the henhouse anymore He asked her why wasnt she happy with the big house henhouse and the full closets anymore He didnt understand how she could be miserable with all that they have while the other fishermans are still living in small cottages

She didnt give up and ordered him to ask the fish for a castle with towers and servants because she cant clean anymore She emphasized that the fish had to grant all of her wishes

The fisherman tried to convince his wife that they didnt need a castle next to such a big house but he couldnt change her mind He told her it was uncomfortable for him to ask the fish for more wishes but she didnt listen
He went to the sea and called the fish She came and listened to him She understood him and granted his wifes wishes

When he came to the house he saw a magnificent castle with towers and a patio He ran to his wife and they explored the castle together One room was prettier that the other with magnificent mirrors and crystal chandeliers The tables were filled with silver and gold dishware and the servants brought them their meal

The next day they kept on exploring the castle so they walked around the patio and went into the stables Wherever they stepped the servants bowed down to them The husband wanted to know was his wife pleased with her last wish being granted and she confirmed she was but she had an another wish She wanted to become the queen She told her husband to go and find the fish

Unfortunately the fishermans convincing that a castle is enough werent enough because the woman was ruthless He felt uncomfortable about asking the fish for another favor

The fisherman went to the sea and called the fish who already knew he had another wish He didnt even pronounce the wish because she already knew his wife wanted to become the queen

The fisherman was surprised but happy that he didnt have to explain himself to the fish again and she granted his wifes wishes
When the fisherman got back to the castle he saw the new queen that wasnt as pretty as a queen is supposed to be She was obese had a crown and pearl necklace and many golden bracelets

The fisherman was desperate and hoped his wife will be happy about the new situation She had servants who served her and a guard that watched her and the castle

Her satisfaction didnt last long and when the husband wanted to know the cause of her misery she told him she wanted to be an empress because she wanted to be something more than an ordinary queen She ordered him to go back to the fish

He had no courage to do it because the wish has already granted him more that she should have and he didnt want to take advantage of her

The wife didnt give up this time either Her greed was stronger than anything else and he had to leave for the sea again but he was so ashamed that he couldnt look at the fish

He asked her for another wish and she said it will be granted His wife was miserable again and wanted to become the pope The fisherman was astonished by her wish and refused to do it but she made him do it

He went back to the fish and asked for the impossible He felt very uncomfortable but the fish granted the wish When he came home his wife was unhappy again because this time she wanted to be God He though she lost her mind and told her she will be punished for blasphemy She made him go back to the fish

He did it while a terrible storm was raging on outside He tried to call for her but she didnt appear He only heard the hauling of the wind and when he came home he saw the same old cottage with his unsatisfied wife in it

He was thrilled about having things back to normal because he never wanted to live in a luxurious castle filled with expensive things Now he could enjoy fishing again and what he would catch would be enough for him and his wife who was still unsatisfied"
59,Kanlı Madalya,"Very few young people who enlist in the armed services do so with realistic expectations They usually have dreams of glory and honor They want to test their mettle to show how strong and brave they are Young Henry Fleming was no exception

The book opens with Jim Conklin washing his shirt at the bank of a stream One lesson men learn fast when they enlist in the army is how to perform what would have been considered womens work back home After washing his shirt Conklin went back to the camp to spread a rumor he had heard Their troop is finally going to move into battle Some of the men are excited some are anxious but everyone has an opinion But Henry felt he wasnt quite part of the raucous group When the spectacle of a rather round private trying to acquire a horse from a dooryard occurred Henry still didnt join in with the men Even when the occupant of the house a little girl began to chase the man around with a stick he didnt join in with their egging her on He didnt care that the man did not manage to steal the horse

Young Henry was busy day dreaming about his home and missing it Henry thinks the only way a man can show his bravery is through battle Thats why he enlisted against his mothers wishes Henry loved to read tales of Greek heroes He felt men had become complacent Secular and religious education had effaced the throatgrappling instinct or else firm finance held in check the passions

He remembers saying goodbye to his school mates young girls who were watching him march away with sadness in their eyes Feeling like a brave soldier going out to meet sure death he arrives at Washington where his troop is assembled He fondly dreams about the abundance of food the warm smiles from girls and pats on the back from the old men He and his fellow soldiers had such a fuss made over them at each stop that Henry began to feel he was already a heroBut now the realities of day to day camp life have begun to wipe some of the shine off the adventure As he laid in bed daydreaming he began to worry Henry had never been in a situation like

But now the realities of day to day camp life have begun to wipe some of the shine off the adventure As he laid in bed daydreaming he began to worry Henry had never been in a situation like the battle He was afraid he might run When he asked Jim Conklin if he was concerned the man answered that he thought they would follow the rest of the men Fight when they fought run when they ran Henry was glad we were not the only one worried about his own courage

Later he asks his buddy Wilson when he sat down beside him to inquire why he was so glum The boy said he was just thinking and asked why Wilson was so cheered especially since he was just complaining about walking so much and this would require a lot of walking Wilson said he wouldnt mind marching if it was to a goal not just moving from useless spot to useless spot Henry asked him if he was worried about his bravery at the time of battle especially since Wilson was so fearful Wilson says when the time comes he will do his share of fighting and stomps away indignantly

Henry decides that no one else appears to be struggling with the same worries as him therefore he must be a mental outcast The regiment is on the move As they marched the troops began to lose faith in their commanders They were marching at dawn every morning Soon the heat of the day and the forced fast march made them start to drop their backpacks and extra gear They were trimming down to what they needed to eat and shoot Henry began to think of them as a blue demonstration

One morning Henry runs up a hill with his troop expecting to see a full battalion of rebels But what they saw was one dead man stripped of his dignity The men kept running towards the enemy Henry gets swept along with them He knows that not only could he not break through the men to turn around now but if he tripped and fell they would trample him He is sure the commanding officers are sending them to a certain death But the troop stop movement Some of the men build barricades to fire from which they have to leave the next morning when the officers start them marching back over the ground they had already covered The moral of the troops start to dip
But as they move closer and the gunfire grows louder Henrys friend Wilson comes up to him Wilson is afraid he wont survive the coming skirmish and asks Henry to deliver some letters to his loved ones When the troop meets up with the enemy their commander is shot in the hand immediately then the veteran soldiers from up around the less experienced troops to fight The veterans are yelling insults at the enemy but the rookies are too scared to speak including Henry What Henry doesnt realize is hes not the first rookie to experience this fear thats why the veterans box them in so they can prevent them from bolting its not to protect them Henry is sure that when the battle reaches its most fearful he will be the fastest runner

Finally Henrys troop receives fire As the battle commences Henry joins in with his brothers in arms He keeps up a steady rhythm of load fire reload The men around him fought like puppets there was a singular absence of heroic poses He began to see the stories of battle were lies the reality was not at all pretty But the line held and the battle ceased

Henrys troop was exultant They cheered and patted each other on the back After the battle Henry begins to breathe again He takes a look around at the trees and the blue sky How could the world not look different after the bloody battle Nature kept going regardless of the horrors man inflicted on each other

Thinking the worst is over and he has proven his courage Henry begins to relax All his comrades are doing the same But when word comes through the ranks that the enemy has renewed their charge the mood shifts completely Henry decides the enemy is too tough To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubtable dragons When around him soldiers begin to toss down their guns and run Henry joined them Suddenly he realizes that his cap and gun are gone and he is in flight with no plan as to where
When he finally slows down he sees a general atop a horse Thinking the man is the biggest imbecile ever and he would like to throttle the general Henry is surprised to learn his troop held the line and was victorious Feeling guilty and furious he began to pity himself He reasons that it was smart for him to run every soldier should protect himself As he continues to walk away Henry throws a pine cone at a squirrel When the squirrel runs away he takes that as a sign that it is natural to run when faced with danger

Walking along Henry hears a loud roar of battle in the distance Curious he moves toward it Along the way he comes across a line of wounded headed down the road As he falls in next to a tattered man Henry listens to him praise the bravery of his comrades When the tattered man asks where Henry is wounded Henry turns away and slides through the crowd getting away from the man

Walking next to another group of men Henry begins to envy them their wounds their red badge of courage Suddenly Henry realizes that the spectral man he is walking next to is Jim Conklin Jim has been shot and is worried that he will fall down on the road and be trampled by wagons Henry promises to take care of Jim When Henry offers to let Jim lean on him Jim refuses his touch

Soon a man told Henry to get Jim off the road Wagons were coming and Jim looked at deaths door Henry turns to look down the road and Jim takes off for the bushes Henry takes off after his friend only to have the man stop and then drop to the ground in death Turning to see the tattered man has followed them Henry starts back to the road The tattered man is amazed at the strength Jim exhibited to run when he was so badly injured The he says that he doesnt feel well either When Henry asks him if he is about to die too the man says no he just wants some soup and he has children who need him But as he continues to talk Henry realizes the man is dying He calls Henry by another mans name and asks to see his wound His speech is shaky and confused So heartlessly Henry leaves the man and climbs a fence to get away He doesnt want to be tormented anymore on his lack of wound that would necessitate leaving the front lines

As he continues along Henry hears the sounds of battle growing louder He sees a group of infantry headed for the battle and envies them But at the same time he still thinks the battle will turn against his side and he would have been wise to leave On the other hand if they prove victorious he needs a good excuse for leaving

While trying to come up with a plausible reason Henry sees the infantry he envied has met the enemy and been overwhelmed They are in flight He tries to question the men but they are running too fast Finally he grabs a man to ask what happened The man screams at Henry to let him go and then smashes him in the head with the butt of his rifle Now he has his wound his red badge When he can walk again Henry continues until he comes across a helpful man who offers to help Henry find his troop The man leaves Henry with his troop and he realizes he never even saw the mans face who helped him
Henry is just one of many men who are struggling back into the camp They all thought he was dead but are glad to see him mobile After tending to him the corporal assumes the wound is from a musket ball He tells Henry to get some rest

The next morning when he wakes Henry is disoriented and at first thinks all the sleeping men around him are dead But with the bugle horn Henry realizes the mistake His friend Wilson comes to talk with him Right away Henry notices a change in Wilson He is more quiet and reserved They discuss how they lost half their troop the day before Some of the men had wandered into other troops and fought alongside them like Henry did He does not disabuse Wilson of this idea and goes on to tell him Jim Conklin is dead

Henry remembers that he has the letter Wilson had given him He thought to return it then changed his mind Maybe he should hold on to it as an insurance against any further questions Wilson might have about his activities of the day before He thinks about his flight and disdains all the other men who ran when he did They ran haphazardly in terror whereas he ran with dignity After all he was chosen by the gods and doomed to greatness He was invincible Henry was roused from his musings by Wilson asking for his letter back After returning it Henry continues to daydream but now the dreams are about the stories he will have when he returns home and how he will not glorify war

Soon the troop is moved to relieve another troop in the woods Henry is getting fed up with his commanders and begins to complain but stops when he fears someone listening might point out his flight the day before As Henry watches the enemy make their way towards his troop he begins to fume They are treating him like a rat being chased by a cat His battle anger begins to rise He fires and reloads firing again refusing to retreat When the enemy starts to fall back Henry goes after them firing all the while

Finally one of his comrades stops him saying there is nothing left to shoot he has chased them all away The commander is thrilled and praises Henry saying if he had more of him the war would be won When Henry comes down from his battle rage he realizes what happened and is a little amazed at himself

During a lull in the battle they realize one of their men is wounded Wilson offers to go for water to help the wounded man When canteens are thrust upon him for fill ups Henry offers to go along to help When they reach where the stream should have been and wasnt the two stop to watch the battle from their vantage point

They see a general on horseback almost trample a wounded man They overhear the general speaking to his next in command He asks what troops he can spare for a major run The officer names Henrys troop because “they fight like little mule drivers I can spare them best of any” As the officer was riding away the general tells him not to expect any of his mule drivers to come back Henry and Wilson are disheartened They had been so proud of their accomplishments only to learn their commanders had no respect for them When they return to camp with the news of the new orders coming their way the two decide to keep the opinions of the general and officers to themselves

The troop goes forward Twice they are paused but the lieutenant pushes them on to battle Soon Henry focuses on the flag going before him and decides to just follow it Thirsty and exhausted Henry continues to run into the battle Soon he sees the flag falter and fall He and Wilson both run up to the fallen flag bearer grab the flag and continue the charge But as they run the two notice their troop falling back While the lieutenant is yelling at them to continue the men are looking for cover in the trees

Henry manages to get the flag from Wilson and tries to spur the men on to meet the enemy He is filled with rage and wants to achieve victory as a way to get his revenge on the officer who called them mule drivers But he is afraid that even with all his coaxing it is not to be When the battle begins his troop manages to put up a good fight As they push the enemy back Henrys troop begins to feel more enthusiastic The troop feels quite proud of themselves until they realize they hardly achieved any ground Also they hear themselves being berated by the officers But in all that Henry and Wilson are praised for their fighting by the colonel

Henry enters into the next battle with a renewed determination He would keep going no matter what happened As men fell all around him Henry continues on He is carrying the flag and fighting His thoughts are on his corpse lying on the battlefield and the officer who called them mule drivers seeing it He pictured that being a just revenge
Soon Henry realized his regiment was growing weaker and thinning out The only two he knew were still going was Wilson and the lieutenant Trying to rally the troops for a full charge the lieutenant is riding around in the back urging them on After a quick calculation Henry realizes that moving forward is the only choice If they stay there they will all die if they retreat it would gladden the enemy too much and also the hated officers and general When he turns to the men expecting to have to convince them he sees they have all come to the same conclusion They charge forward
When they reach the enemy Henrys regiment are victorious The enemy retreats and they capture four prisoners Also Henry and Wilson see the other flag bearer go down and they both dive for the enemys flag Wilson retrieves it successfully ending the battle

After a brief rest while Henry and Wilson discuss the battle more orders come down The troop must head back to the river As Henry walks he contemplates his actions of the day before Although he is still ashamed and expects the face of the tattered man will be in his mind always he puts it all behind him He dreams of a future past the war He has gone from a boy with dreams of glory to a man with dreams of peace"
